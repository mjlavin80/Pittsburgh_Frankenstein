"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided
to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish
dominions.

"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of
his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise
that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained
with them in expectation of that event; and in the mean time he
enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the
simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another
through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the
interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of
her native country.

"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes of
the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He
loathed the idea that his daughter should
be united to a Christian; but he feared the resentment of Felix if he
should appear lukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of his
deliverer, if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited.
He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the
deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his
daughter with him when he departed. His plans were greatly facilitated by
the news which arrived from Paris.
