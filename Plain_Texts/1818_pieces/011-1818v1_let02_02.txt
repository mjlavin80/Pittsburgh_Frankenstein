But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the
absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil.  I have no friend, Margaret: when I am
glowing with the enthusiasm of
success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by
disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall
commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the
communication of feeling. I desire
the company of a man who could sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply
to mine. You may deem me romantic,
my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one
near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a
capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my
plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution, and too
impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am
self-educated: for the first
fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a
common, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At
that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country;
but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most
important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity
of becoming acquainted with more
languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more
illiterate than many school-boys of fifteen. It is true that I have
thought more, and that my day
dreams are more extended and magnificent; but they want (as the
painters call it) keeping;
and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me
as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.
