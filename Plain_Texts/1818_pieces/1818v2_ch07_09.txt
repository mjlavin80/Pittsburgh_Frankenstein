"'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless,
cannot you undeceive them?'

"'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that
account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love
these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in
the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that
I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to
overcome.'

"'Where do these friends reside?'

"'Near this spot.'

"The old man paused, and then continued, 'If you will
unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I
perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind, and cannot
judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words
which persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor, and an exile;
but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable
to a human creature.'

"'Excellent man! I thank you, and accept your generous offer.
You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by
your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of
your fellow-creatures.'

"'Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal; for that can only drive you to desperation, and
not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my family
have been condemned, although innocent: judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your
misfortunes.'
