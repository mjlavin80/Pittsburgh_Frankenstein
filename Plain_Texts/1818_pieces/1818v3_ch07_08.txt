By the quantity of provision which I had consumed I should
guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the
continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart,
often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes.
Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon
have sunk beneath this misery; when once, after the poor animals
that carried me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a
sloping ice mountain, and one sinking under his fatigue died, I
viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to
discover what it could be, and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when
I distinguished a sledge, and the distorted proportions of a
well-known form within. Oh! with what a burning gush did
hope revisit my heart! warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily
wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the
daemon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops,
until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept
aloud.

But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs
of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food;
and, after an hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and
yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The
sledge was still visible; nor did I again lose sight of it, except
at the moments when for a short time some ice rock concealed it
with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it;
and when, after nearly two days' journey, I beheld my enemy at no
more than a mile distant, my
heart bounded within me.
