"Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted
you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, my dear girl; I will
every where proclaim your innocence, and force belief.  Yet you
must die; you, my playfellow, my companion, my more than sister.
I never can survive so horrible a misfortune."

"Dear, sweet Elizabeth, do not weep.  You ought to raise me
with thoughts of a better life, and elevate me from the petty
cares of this world of injustice and strife.  Do not you,
excellent friend, drive me to despair."

"I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil too deep and
poignant to admit of consolation, for there is no hope. Yet heaven bless
thee, my dearest Justine, with resignation, and a confidence elevated
beyond this world.  Oh! how I hate its shews and mockeries! when one
creature is murdered, another is immediately deprived of life in a slow
torturing manner; then the executioners, their hands yet reeking with the
blood of innocence, believe that they have done a great deed.  They call
this retribution.  Hateful
name!  When that word is pronounced, I know greater and more horrid
punishments are going to be inflicted than the gloomiest tyrant has ever
invented to satiate his utmost revenge.  Yet this is not consolation for
you, my Justine, unless indeed that you may glory in escaping from so
miserable a den.  Alas!  I would I were in peace with my aunt and my
lovely William, escaped from a world which is hateful to me, and the
visages of men which I abhor."

Justine smiled languidly.  "This, dear lady, is despair, and not resignation. 
I must not learn the lesson that you would teach me.  Talk of something else,
something that will bring peace, and not increase of misery."
