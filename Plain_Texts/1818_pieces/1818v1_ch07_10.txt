Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in
a voice of half-suppressed emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady,
dearest Elizabeth, my beloved
and only friend; may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve
you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer.
Live, and be happy, and make
others so."

As we returned, Elizabeth said, "You know not, my dear Victor,
how much I am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this
unfortunate girl.  I never could again have known peace, if I had
been deceived in my reliance on her.  For the moment that I did
believe her guilty, I felt an anguish that I could not have long
sustained.  Now my heart is lightened.  The innocent suffers; but
she whom I thought amiable and good has not betrayed the trust I
reposed in her, and I am consoled."

Amiable cousin! such were your thoughts, mild and gentle as your
own dear eyes and voice.  But I -- I was a wretch, and none ever conceived of the
misery that I then endured.
