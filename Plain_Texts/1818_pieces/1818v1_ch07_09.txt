During this conversation I
had retired to a corner of the
prison-room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that
possessed me.  Despair!  Who dared talked of that?  The poor victim,
who on the morrow was to pass the dreary boundary between life
and death, felt not as I did,
such deep and bitter agony. I
gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a groan that
came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it
was, she approached me, and said, "Dear Sir, you are very kind to
visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty."

I could not answer. "No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is
more convinced of your innocence than I was; for even when he
heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it."

"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the
sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.
How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It
removes more than half my misfortune; and I feel as if I could
die in peace, now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear
lady, and your cousin."

Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.  She indeed
gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the
never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy; but her's also was the
misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon,
for a while hides, but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair
had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me, which nothing
could extinguish. We staid several hours with Justine; and it was with
great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. "I wish," cried
she, "that I were to die with you; I
cannot live in this world of misery."
