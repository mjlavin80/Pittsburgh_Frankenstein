"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure
the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I
knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I
had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the
oppressive sense of the injustice
and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge -- a deep and deadly revenge, such as
would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.

"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours
I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle
breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my desolate state, and made me feel
more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.

"But my toils now drew near a close; and, two months from this time, I
reached the environs of Geneva.

"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the
fields that surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply to you.
I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the
gentle breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting behind the
stupendous mountains of Jura.

"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running
into the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy.
Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this little creature
was unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror
of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him, and educate him as my
companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled
earth.
