As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that I improved
rapidly. My ardour was indeed the
astonishment of the students; and
my proficiency, that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with
a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed
the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this
manner, during which I paid no visit to
Geneva, but was engaged, heart and
soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make. None
but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of
science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you,
and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and
wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely pursues one study,
must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit, and was solely
wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I
made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments,
which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I
had arrived at this point, and had become as well acquainted with the
theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of
any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer
conducive to my improvements, I thought
of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
happened that protracted my stay.
