Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy
again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had
gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those muscles
and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even
Dante could not have conceived.

I passed the night wretchedly.
Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly, that I felt the palpitation
of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor
and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of
disappointment: dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long
a space, were now become a hell to me;
and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!

Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless
and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which
indicated the sixth hour. The porter
opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I
issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to
avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present
to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but
felt impelled to hurry on, although wetted by the rain, which poured from
a black and comfortless sky.
