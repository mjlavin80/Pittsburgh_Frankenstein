Beyond Cologne we descended to the
plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream of
the river was too gentle to aid us.

Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful
scenery; but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we
proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of September, that
I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames
presented a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost
every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort, and remembered
the Spanish armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, places which I had
heard of even in my country.

At length, we saw the numerous steeples
of London, St. Paul's
towering above all, and the Tower
famed
in English history.
