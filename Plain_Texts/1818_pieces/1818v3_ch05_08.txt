As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from
cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.
But I concealed my feelings by
an appearance of hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the
countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful
and nicer eye of Elizabeth.
She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not
unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had
impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness,
might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace but
deep and everlasting regret.

Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits
were received; and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as
well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there,
and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although
they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. A house
was purchased for us near Cologny, by which we should
enjoy the pleasures of the country, and yet be so near Geneva as
to see my father every day; who would still reside within the
walls, for the benefit of Ernest, that he might follow
his studies at the schools.

In the mean time I took every precaution to defend my person,
in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and
a dagger constantly about me, and was ever on the watch to
prevent artifice; and by these means gained a greater degree of
tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat
appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to
disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage
wore a greater appearance of certainty, as the day fixed for its
solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken of as
an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.
