"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I
came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid
river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now
budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing
what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that
induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was
scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot
where I was concealed, laughing as if she ran from some one in
sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides of
the river, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she fell into the
rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding place, and, with extreme
labour from the force of the current, saved her, and dragged her
to shore. She was senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in
my power, to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by
the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she
had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and,
tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts
of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the
man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my
body, and fired. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer, with
increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.

"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being
from destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the miserable
pain of a wound, which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of
kindness and gentleness, which I had entertained but a few moments before,
gave place to hellish rage and gnashing
of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed
eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound
overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.
