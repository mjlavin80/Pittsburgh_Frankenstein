Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly
to calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfill my wishes and my
destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil
pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful
secret, which I had promised to reveal to her on the following
day. My father was in the mean time overjoyed, and, in the bustle
of preparation, only observed in the melancholy of his niece the
diffidence of a bride.

After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my
father's; but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should pass the
afternoon and night at Evian,
and return to Cologny the next morning.  As the day was fair, and
the wind favourable, we resolved to go by water.

Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling
of happiness. We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were
sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy, while we enjoyed the beauty
of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of
Montalêgre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont
Blânc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour
to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty
Jura opposing its dark side to the
ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable
barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.

I took the hand of Elizabeth: "You are sorrowful, my love.
Ah! if you knew what I have suffered, and what I may yet endure,
you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet, and freedom from
despair, that this one day at least permits me to enjoy."
