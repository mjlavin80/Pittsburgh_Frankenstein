It may appear very strange, that a disciple of Albertus Magnus should
arise in the eighteenth century; but our family was not scientifical, and
I had not attended any of the lectures given at the schools of Geneva.  My
dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the
greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of
life. But the latter obtained my
undivided attention: wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the discovery,
if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render man
invulnerable to any but a violent death!

Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a
promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfillment of
which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always
unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and
mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.

The natural ph√¶nomena that take place every day before our eyes did
not escape my examinations.  Distillation, and the wonderful effects
of steam, processes of which my favourite authors were utterly ignorant,
excited my astonishment; but my utmost wonder was engaged by some experiments on an air-pump, which I saw
employed by a gentleman whom we were in the habit of visiting.

The ignorance of the early philosophers on these and several
other points served to decrease their credit with me:  but I
could not entirely throw them aside, before some other system
should occupy their place in my mind.
