To Mrs. Sᴀᴠɪʟʟᴇ, England. 
Archangel, 28th March, 17--. 
How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.
