"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and
drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes, 
and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face, and 
said, 'Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; 
listen to me.'

"He struggled violently; 'Let me go,' he cried; 'monster! ugly wretch! you wish to eat
me, and tear me to pieces -- You are an
ogre -- Let me go, or I will tell my papa.'

"'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come
with me.'

"'Hideous monster! let me go; My papa is a Syndic -- he is M. 
Frankenstein -- he would punish you. You dare not keep me.'

"'Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy -- to him towards
whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.'

"The child still struggled, and loaded
me with epithets which carried despair to my heart: I grasped his
throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.

"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph: clapping my hands, I
exclaimed, 'I, too, can create desolation; my enemy is not impregnable;
this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall
torment and destroy him.'
