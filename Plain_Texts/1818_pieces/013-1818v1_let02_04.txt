The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in
the ship for his gentleness, and
the mildness of his discipline. He is, indeed, of so amiable a nature,
that he will not hunt (a favourite,
and almost the only amusement here), because he cannot endure to spill
blood.  He is, moreover, heroically generous.  Some years ago he loved a
young Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and having amassed a considerable
sum in prize-money, the father of
the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the
destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing herself at
his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she
loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never
consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on
being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit.
He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to
pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival,
together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then
himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to her marriage with
her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in
honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his
country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married
according to her inclinations. "What a
noble fellow!" you will exclaim.  He is so; but then he has passed all
his life on board a vessel, and has scarcely an idea beyond the rope and
the shroud.
