Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage
with my cousin. I remained silent.

"Have you, then, some other attachment?"

"None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union
with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will
consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my
cousin."

"My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have
befallen us; but let us only cling closer to what remains, and
transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet
live. Our circle will be
small, but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual
misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will
be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
deprived."

Such were the lessons of my
father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned: nor
can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his
deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible; and
that when he had pronounced the words, "I shall be with you on
your wedding-night," I should regard the threatened fate as
unavoidable. But death was no evil to me, if the loss of
Elizabeth were balanced with it; and I therefore, with a
contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father,
that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place
in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.

Great God! if for one instant I had thought what might be the
hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have
banished myself for ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over
the earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage.
But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me
to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared
only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.
