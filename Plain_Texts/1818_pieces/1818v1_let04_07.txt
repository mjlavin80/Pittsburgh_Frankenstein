"I agree with you," replied the stranger, "in believing that friendship is
not only a desirable, but a possible acquisition. I once had a friend, the most noble of
human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. 
You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But 
I -- I have lost every thing, and cannot 
begin life anew."

As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm
settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent,
and presently retired to his cabin.

Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does
the beauties of nature. The starry
sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems
still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a
double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by
disappointments; yet when he has retired
into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo
around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.

Will you laugh at the enthusiasm I
express concerning this divine
wanderer? If you do, you must have certainly lost that simplicity
which was once your characteristic charm.  Yet, if you will, smile at the
warmth of my expressions, while I find every day new causes for repeating
them.
