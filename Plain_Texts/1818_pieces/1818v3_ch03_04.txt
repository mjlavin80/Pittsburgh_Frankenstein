"The hour of my weakness is past,
and the period of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot
move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a resolution of not creating you
a companion in vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon
the earth a d√¶mon,
whose delight is in death and wretchedness. Begone! I am firm,
and your words will only exasperate my rage."

The monster saw my determination in my face, and gnashed his teeth in the
impotence of anger. "Shall each man," cried he, "find a wife for
his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and
they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man, you may hate;
but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon
the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
ever. Are you to be happy, while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You can
blast my other passions; but revenge remains -- revenge,
henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die; but first
you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on
your misery. Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful. I
will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with
its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict."

"Devil, cease; and do not
poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared my
resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words.
Leave me; I am inexorable."

"It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your
wedding-night."

I started forward, and exclaimed, "Villain! before you sign
my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe."
