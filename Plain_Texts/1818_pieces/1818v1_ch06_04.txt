Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this
letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded to
the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my friends. I
threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.

"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
weep with bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy? My dear
friend, what has happened?"

I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up
and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed
from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my
misfortune.

"I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he; "your
disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?"

"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the
horses."

During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to raise my spirits.  He did not do
this by common topics of consolation, but by exhibiting the truest sympathy.  "Poor William!" said
he, "that dear child; he now sleeps with
his angel mother.  His friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest:  he
does not now feel the murderer's grasp; a sod covers his gentle form, and
he knows no pain. He can no longer be a fit subject for pity; the
survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the only
consolation.  Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that
the mind of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of
a beloved object, ought not to be urged.  Even Cato wept over the dead body of his
brother."
