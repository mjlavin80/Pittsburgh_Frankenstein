"My uncle and I conversed a long time last night about what
profession Ernest should follow.  His constant illness when young
has deprived him of the habits of application; and now that he
enjoys good health, he is continually in the open air, climbing
the hills, or rowing on the lake.  I therefore proposed that he
should be a farmer; which you know, Cousin, is a favourite scheme
of mine.  A farmer's is a very healthy happy life; and the least
hurtful, or rather the most beneficial profession of any.  My
uncle had an idea of his being educated as an advocate, that through his interest he might become
a judge.  But, besides that he is not at all fitted for such
an occupation, it is certainly more creditable to cultivate the
earth for the sustenance of man, than to be the confidant,
and sometimes the accomplice, of his vices; which is the
profession of a lawyer.  I said, that the employments of a
prosperous farmer, if they were not a more honourable, they were
at least a happier species of occupation than that of a judge,
whose misfortune it was always to meddle with the dark side of
human nature.  My uncle smiled, and said, that I ought to be
an advocate myself, which put an end to the conversation on that
subject.
