THE next day, contrary to the prognostications of our guides, was fine, although clouded.  We visited the source of the Arveiron, and rode about the valley until evening.  These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling; and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I returned in the evening, fatigued, but less unhappy, and conversed with my family with more cheerfulness than had been my custom for some time.  My father was pleased, and Elizabeth overjoyed.  "My dear cousin," said she, "you see what happiness you diffuse when you are happy; do not relapse again!" 
The following morning the rain poured down in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains.  I rose early, but felt unusually melancholy.  The rain depressed me; my old feelings recurred, and I was miserable.  I knew how disappointed my father would be at this sudden change, and I wished to avoid him until I had recovered myself so far as to be enabled to conceal those feelings that overpowered me.  I knew that they would remain that day at the inn; and as I had ever inured myself to rain, moisture, and cold, I resolved to go alone to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go alone, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.
