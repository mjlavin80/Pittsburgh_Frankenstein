When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the
men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him
to be tormented by their idle
curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently
depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he
had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?

His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest
gloom; and he replied, "To seek one who fled from me."

"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same
fashion?"

"Yes."

"Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked
you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it,
across the ice."

This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a
multitude of questions concerning the route which the d√¶mon, as
he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with
me, he said, "I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as
well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to
make inquiries."

"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman
in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine."

"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous
situation; you have benevolently restored me to
life."
