"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.
My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a
vice, I confess that it is the
devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is
unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned
loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand: I
have but one resource; and I devote myself, either in my life or
death, to his destruction."

I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a
phrenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty
fierceness, which the martyrs
of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those
of devotion and heroism, this
elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He
endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to
my tale as the effects of delirium.

"Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say."
I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to
meditate on some other mode of action.
