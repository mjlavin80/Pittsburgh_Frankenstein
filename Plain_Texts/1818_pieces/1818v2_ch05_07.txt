days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had,
all my past life was now a blot, a blind
vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance
I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a
being resembling me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I?

"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to
return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings
of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in
additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an
innocent, half painful self-deceit,
to call them).
