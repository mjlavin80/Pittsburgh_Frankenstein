"That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events,
become the most miserable of
mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can
death be any evil to me?"

"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have
lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising
accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality: seized
immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was
presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in
so unaccountable a manner, and placed, as it were, by some fiend
across your path."

As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I
endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt
considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess
concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my
countenance; for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say--

"It was not until a day or two after your illness that I thought
of examining your dress, that I might discover some trace by
which I could send to your
relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found
several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from
its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to
Geneva: nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my
letter. -- But you are ill; even now you tremble: you are unfit
for agitation of any kind."

"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most
horrible event: tell me what new scene of death has been acted,
and whose murder I am now to lament."

"Your family is perfectly well," said Mr. Kirwin, with
gentleness; "and some one, a friend, is come to visit you."
