A fever succeeded to this. I
lay for two months on the point of death: my ravings, as I
afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer
of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I
was tormented; and, at others, I felt the fingers of the monster
already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and
terror. Fortunately, as I
spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but
my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the
other witnesses.

Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before,
why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches
away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doating
parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in
the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and
the decay of the tomb! Of what
materials was I made, that I could thus resist so many
shocks, which, like the turning
of the wheel, continually renewed the torture.

But I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as awaking from
a dream, in a prison, stretched on a
wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the
miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus
awoke to understanding: I had forgotten the particulars of what had
happened, and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly
overwhelmed me; but when I looked around, and saw the barred windows, and
the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory,
and I groaned bitterly.
