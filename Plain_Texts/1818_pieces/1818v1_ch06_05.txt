Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed
themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But
now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriole, and bade farewell to my
friend.

My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I
longed to console and sympathize with my loved and sorrowing friends; but
when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly
sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed
through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly
six years. How altered every thing might be during that time? One sudden
and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading a
thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to
define them.

I remained two days at Lausanne, in
this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were
placid; all around was calm, and the snowy mountains, "the palaces of nature," were not
changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I
continued my journey towards Geneva.

The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I
approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont
Blanc; I wept like a child: "Dear 
mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your 
summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to 
prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?"
