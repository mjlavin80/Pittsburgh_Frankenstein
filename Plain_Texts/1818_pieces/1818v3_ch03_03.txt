In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as
if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head
to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was, and wished to rouse
one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but
I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in
frightful dreams, when you in
vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was
rooted to the spot.

Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the
door opened, and the wretch
whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me, and
said, in a smothered
voice--

"You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that
you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured
toil and misery: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the
shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands, and over the
summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of
England, and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured
incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy
my hopes?"

"Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another
like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness."

"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you
believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched
that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator,
but I am your master; --
obey!"
