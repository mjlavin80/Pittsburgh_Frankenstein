"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he
is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eye-lashes,
and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek,
which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little
wives, but Louisa Biron is his
favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.

"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of
Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory
visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John
Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last
autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several
misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already
recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a
very lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much
older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with
every body.

"I have written myself into good spirits, dear cousin; yet I
cannot conclude without again anxiously inquiring concerning your
health.  Dear Victor, if you are not very ill, write yourself,
and make your father and all of us happy; or -- I cannot bear to
think of the other side of the question; my tears already flow.
Adieu, my dearest cousin.

"ELIZABETH
LAVENZA.

"Geneva, March 18th, 17--."
