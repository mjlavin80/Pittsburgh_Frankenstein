The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave
way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their
murderer also lived, and to
destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on
the grass, and kissed the earth, and with quivering lips
exclaimed, "By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades
that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I
swear; and by thee, O Night, and
by the spirits that preside over thee, I swear to pursue the
daemon, who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in
mortal conflict. For this purpose I will preserve my life: to
execute this dear revenge, will I again behold the sun, and tread
the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead; and on
you, wandering ministers of
vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster
drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments
me."

I had begun my abjuration with solemnity, and an awe which
almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard
and approved my devotion; but the furies possessed me as I
concluded, and rage choaked my utterance.

I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and
fiendish laugh. It rung on my ears long and heavily; the
mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me
with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have
been possessed by phrenzy, and have destroyed my miserable
existence, but that my vow was
heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter
died away: when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close
to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper -- "I am satisfied:
miserable wretch! you have
determined to live, and I am satisfied."
