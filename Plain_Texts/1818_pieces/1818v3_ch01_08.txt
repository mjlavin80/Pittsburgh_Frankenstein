------  "The sounding cataract
Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
Their colours and their forms, were then to him
An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
That had no need of a remoter charm,
By thought supplied, or any interest
Unborrowed from the eye*."

* Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey.

And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being
lost forever? Has this mind so replete with ideas, imaginations
fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence
depended on the life of its creator; has this mind perished?  Does it now only
exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely
wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit
still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.

Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a
slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe
my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my
tale.
