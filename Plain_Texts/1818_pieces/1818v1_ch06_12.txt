We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had made great
alterations in her form since I had last beheld her.  Six years
before she had been a pretty, good-humoured girl, whom every one
loved and caressed.  She was now a woman in stature and
expression of countenance, which was uncommonly lovely.  An open
and capacious forehead gave indications of a good understanding,
joined to great frankness of disposition.  Her eyes
were hazel,
and expressive of mildness, now through recent affliction allied
to sadness.  Her hair was of a rich dark auburn, her complexion
fair, and her figure slight and graceful.  She welcomed me with
the greatest affection. "Your arrival, my dear cousin," said she,
"fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify
my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted
of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my
own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost
that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely
love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is
condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am
sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after
the sad death of my little William."

"She is innocent, my Elizabeth," said I, "and that shall be
proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the
assurance of her acquittal."

"How kind you are! every one else believes in her
guilt, and
that made me wretched; for I knew that it was impossible: and to
see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner, rendered me
hopeless and despairing." She wept.

"Sweet niece," said my father, "dry your tears. If she is, as you believe,
innocent, rely on the justice of our
judges, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest
shadow of partiality."
