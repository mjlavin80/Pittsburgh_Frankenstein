Partly from curiosity, and partly from 
idleness, I went into the lecturing
room, which M. Waldman entered
shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared
about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back
of his head were nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect;
and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a
recapitulation of the history of chemistry, and the various improvements
made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of
the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the
present state of the science, and explained many of its elementary terms.
After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a
panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never
forget:--

"The ancient teachers of this science," said he, "promised
impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very
little; they know that metals cannot be
transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these
philosophers, whose hands seem only
made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed
miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature, and shew how she
works in her hiding places. They ascend
into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They
have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the
thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible
world with its own shadows."
