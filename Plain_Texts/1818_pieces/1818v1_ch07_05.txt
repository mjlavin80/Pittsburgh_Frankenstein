Excellent Elizabeth!  A murmur of approbation was heard; but it was
excited by her generous interference, and not in favor of poor Justine, on
whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her
with the blackest ingratitude. She
herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation
and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her
innocence; I knew it. Could the d√¶mon, who had (I did not for a
minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed
the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my
situation; and when I perceived that the popular voice, and the
countenances of the judges, had already condemned my unhappy victim, I
rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal
mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would
not forego their hold.

I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the
court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal
question; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.
The ballots had been thrown; they
were all black, and Justine was condemned.

I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced
sensations of horror; and I have
endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot
convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The
person to whom I addressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed her guilt. "That evidence,"
he observed, "was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of
it; and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon
circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive."
