If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to
me, that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a
modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much greater
powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former
were real and practical; under such circumstances, I should certainly have
thrown Agrippa aside, and, with my imagination warmed as it was, should
probably have applied myself to the more rational theory of chemistry which has
resulted from modern discoveries.  It is even possible, that the train of
my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But
the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me
that he was acquainted with its contents; and I continued to read with the
greatest avidity.

When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this
author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied
the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
treasures known to few beside myself; and although I have often wished to
communicate these secret stores of
knowledge to my father, yet his indefinite censure of my favourite
Agrippa always withheld me.  I disclosed my discoveries to Elizabeth,
therefore, under a promise of strict secrecy; but she did not interest
herself in the subject, and I was left by her to pursue my studies alone.
