"And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I
resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and
despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of
you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father,
my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who
had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie
geography had not been omitted: I had learned from these the relative
situations of the different countries of the earth. You had mentioned
Geneva as the name of your native town; and towards this place I resolved
to proceed.

"But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a
south-westerly direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my only
guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through,
nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not
despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I
felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! you had
endowed me with perceptions and passions, and then cast me abroad an
object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any
claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to
gain from any other being that wore the human form.
