Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed
for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents,
winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded
until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to
see my native town, and my beloved friends. My return had only been
delayed so long from an unwillingness
to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted
with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully;
and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came, its beauty
compensated for its dilatoriness.

The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the
letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when
Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt
that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long
inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was
fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite
companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among
the scenes of my native country.
