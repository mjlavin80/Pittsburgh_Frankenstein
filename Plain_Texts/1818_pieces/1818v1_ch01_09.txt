When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most
violent and terrible thunder-storm.
It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at once with
frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while
the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I
stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old
and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
remained but a blasted stump. When
we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular
manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin
ribbands of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.

The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme astonishment; and I
eagerly inquired of my father the nature and origin of thunder and
lightning.  He replied, "Electricity;" describing at the same
time the various effects of that power.  He constructed a small electrical
machine, and exhibited a few experiments; he made also a kite, with a wire and string, which drew
down that fluid from the clouds.

This last stroke completed the overthrow of Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, who had so long reigned the
lords of my imagination.  But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to
commence the study of any modern system; and this disinclination was
influenced by the following circumstance.
