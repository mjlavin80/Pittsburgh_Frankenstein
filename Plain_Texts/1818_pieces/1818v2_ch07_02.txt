"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in
me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to
ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the
Sorrows of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
story, so many opinions are canvassed, and so many lights thrown upon what
had hitherto been to me obscure subjects, that I found in it a
never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and
domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with
my experience among my protectors, and with the wants which were for ever
alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being
than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension,
but it sunk deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated
to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the
case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I
wept, without precisely understanding it.

"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and
condition. I found myself similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike
the beings concerning whom I read, and to whose conversation I was a
listener. I sympathized with, and
partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on
none and related to none. 'The path of my
departure was free;' and there was none to lament my annihilation. My
person was hideous and my stature gigantic: what did this mean? Who was I? What was I?
Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions
continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.
