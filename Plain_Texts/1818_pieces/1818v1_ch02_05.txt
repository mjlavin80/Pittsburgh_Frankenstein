I returned home, not disappointed, for I had long considered those authors
useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I did not feel
much inclined to study the books which I had procured at his
recommendation.  M. Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and
repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
favour of his doctrine.  Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural
philosophy. It was very different, when the masters of the science
sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand: but
now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those
visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was
required to exchange chimeras of
boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.

Such were my reflections during the first two or three days spent 
almost in solitude.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the
information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And
although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow 
deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. 
Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
