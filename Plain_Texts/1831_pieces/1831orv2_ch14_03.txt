"I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in
the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were
often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart, I will give them
to you, they will prove the truth of my
tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only
have time to repeat the substance of them to you.

"Safie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by
her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her.
The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who,
born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets
of her religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
intellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female followers of
Mahomet. This lady died; but her lessons were indelibly impressed on
the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to
Asia, and being immured within the walls of a haram, allowed only to
occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her
soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The
prospect of marrying a Christian, and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in
society, was enchanting to her.

"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the
night previous to it, he quitted his prison, and before morning
was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports
in the name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously
communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by
quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey, and
concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of
Paris.
