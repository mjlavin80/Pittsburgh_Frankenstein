"'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have food; it is
warmth and rest only that I need.'

"I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute
was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to
commence the interview; when the old man addressed me--

"'By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman;
-- are you French?'

"'No; but I was educated by a French family, and understand
that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of
some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have
some hopes.'

"'Are they Germans?'

"'No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate
and deserted creature; I look around, and I have no relation or friend upon
earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me, and know
little of me. I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I am an
outcast in the world for ever.'

"'Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate; but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by
any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely,
therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do
not despair.'

"'They are kind -- they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good
dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless, and in some degree
beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought
to see a feeling and kind friend,
they behold only a detestable
monster.'
