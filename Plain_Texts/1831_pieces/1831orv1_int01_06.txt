"We will each write a ghost story," said Lord Byron; and his proposition
was acceded to.  There were four of us.  The noble author began a tale, a fragment of which he printed at the
end of his poem of Mazeppa.  Shelley, more apt to embody ideas and
sentiments in the radiance of brilliant imagery, commenced one founded on
the experiences of his early life.  Poor Polidori had some terrible idea about a
skull-headed lady, who was so punished for peeping through a key-hole --
what to see I forget -- something very shocking and wrong of course; but
when she was reduced to a worse condition than the renowned Tom of Coventry, he did
not know what to do with her, and was obliged to despatch her to the tomb of the Capulets, the only
place for which she was fitted.  The illustrious poets also, annoyed by
the platitude of prose, speedily relinquished the uncongenial task.
