"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little
darling William. I wish
you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet
laughing blue eyes, dark eye-lashes, and curling hair. When he
smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy
with health. He has already had one or two little wives,
but Louisa Biron is his
favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.

"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little
gossip concerning the good
people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received
the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a
young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon,
married M. Duvillard, the
rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis
Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of
Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spirits,
and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively
pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much
older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite
with everybody.

"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my
anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor, --
one line -- one word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand
thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many
letters: we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care
of yourself; and, I entreat you, write!

"ELIZABETH
LAVENZA.

"Geneva, March 18th, 17--."
