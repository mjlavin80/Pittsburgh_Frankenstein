These reflections have dispelled the
agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with
an enthusiasm which elevates me to
heaven; for nothing contributes so much to tranquilise the mind as a
steady purpose, -- a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has
been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the
accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific
Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that
a history of all the voyages made for
purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle Thomas's
library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of
reading. These volumes were my study day and
night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had
felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden
my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.

These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose
effusions entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven.I also became a poet, and for one year
lived in a Paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might
obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are
consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I
bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of
my cousin, and my thoughts were
turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
