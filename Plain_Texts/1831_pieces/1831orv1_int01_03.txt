I lived principally in the country as
a girl, and passed a considerable time in Scotland.  I made occasional
visits to the more picturesque parts; but my habitual residence was on the
blank and dreary northern shores of the Tay, near Dundee.  Blank and
dreary on retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then.  They
were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region where unheeded I could
commune with the creatures of my fancy.  I wrote then -- but in a most
common-place style.  It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to
our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my
true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and
fostered.  I did not make myself the heroine of my tales.  Life appeared
to me too common-place an affair as regarded myself.  I could not figure
to myself that romantic woes or wonderful events would ever be my lot; but
I was not confined to my own identity, and I could people the hours with creations
far more interesting to me at that age, than my own sensations.
