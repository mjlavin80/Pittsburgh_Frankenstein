When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a
long time concerning the manner in which
I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing
animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its
intricacies of fibres, muscles, and
veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I
doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one 
of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted 
by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to 
an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present 
within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking; 
but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for 
a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and 
at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I considered the improvement 
which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to 
hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future 
success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as 
any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I 
began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts 
formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first 
intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature; that is to say, about 
eight feet in height, and 
proportionably large. After having formed this determination, and having 
spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, 
I began.
