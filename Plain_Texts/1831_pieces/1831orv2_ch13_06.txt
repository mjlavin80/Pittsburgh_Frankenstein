"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon
me: I tried to dispel them, but sorrow
only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in 
my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!

"Of what a strange nature is
knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized on it, like
a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and
feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the
sensation of pain, and that was death -- a state which I feared yet did
not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings, and loved the gentle
manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I was shut out from
intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth,
when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied
the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of
Agatha, and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian, were not for me.
The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of the
loved Felix, were not for me. Miserable,
unhappy wretch!

"Other lessons were impressed upon me even
more deeply. I heard of the difference of sexes; and the birth and
growth of children; how the father doated on the smiles of the infant, and
the lively sallies of the older child; how all the life and cares of the
mother were wrapped up in the precious charge; how the mind of youth
expanded and gained knowledge; of brother, sister, and all the various
relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.
