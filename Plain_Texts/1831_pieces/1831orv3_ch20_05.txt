I would have seized him; but he eluded me, and quitted the house
with precipitation: in a few moments I saw him in his boat, which
shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness, and was soon lost amidst the
waves.

All was again silent; but his words rung in my ears. I burned
with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace, and precipitate him
into the ocean. I walked up and down my room hastily and
perturbed, while my imagination
conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why
had I not followed him, and closed with him in mortal strife? But
I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course
towards the main land. I shuddered to think who might be the next
victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought
again of his words -- "I will be with you on your
wedding-night." That then
was the period fixed for the fulfillment of my destiny. In
that hour I should die, and at once satisfy and extinguish his
malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought
of my beloved Elizabeth, -- of her tears and endless sorrow, when
she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, --
tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my
eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter
struggle.

The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my
feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness, when the
violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I left the
house, the horrid scene of the last night's contention, and
walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an
insuperable barrier between me and my fellow-creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the
fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on
that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any
sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed,
or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a d√¶mon whom I had
myself created.
