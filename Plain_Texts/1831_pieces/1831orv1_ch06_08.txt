We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had
long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the
conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the
intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval
called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love
the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely did
you love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind, until it was on a level
with your own!  A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your
gentleness and affection warmed and
opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago,
loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate
nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A
serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine;
the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while
those of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which
during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my
endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.

Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he
exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled
his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in
imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of
wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite
poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great
ingenuity.

We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were
dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were
high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.
