Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to
reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose,
about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town,
and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I knew
the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his
whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.

The magistrate listened to me with attention and
kindness:-- "Be assured, sir," said he, "no pains or exertions on my
part shall be spared to discover the villain."

"I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefore, to the
deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange,
that I should fear you would not credit it, were there not
something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction.
The story is too connected to
be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood." My
manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but calm; I had
formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to
death; and this purpose quieted my agony, and for an interval
reconciled me to life. I now related my history, briefly, but with
firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy, and
never deviating into invective or exclamation.

The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but
as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him
sometimes shudder with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was
painted on his countenance.

When I had concluded my narration, I said, "This is the being whom I
accuse, and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your
whole power. It is your duty as a
magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will
not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion."
