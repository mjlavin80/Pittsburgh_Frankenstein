"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
occupation, that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see:
but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
end, and that I am at length
free."

I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick
pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought
made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might
still be there, alive, and walking 
about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more
that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few
minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My
hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I
then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly
open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped
fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bed-room was also freed from
its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune
could have befallen me; but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my
hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.

We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but
I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of
sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a
single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my
hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits
to joy on his arrival; but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a
wildness in my eyes for which he
could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter, frightened and
astonished him.
