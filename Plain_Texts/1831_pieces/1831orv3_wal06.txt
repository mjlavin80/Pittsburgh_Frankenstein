A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording  it. 
We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate  comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation.  Frankenstein has daily declined in health: a feverish fire still  glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused  to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness. 
I mentioned in my last letter the fears I  entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan  countenance of my friend -- his eyes half closed, and his limbs hanging  listlessly, -- I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me, to make me a requisition, which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice, and should probably never escape; but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate, and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage, and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise, that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southward.
