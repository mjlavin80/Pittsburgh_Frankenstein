Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can,
even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by
inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several
expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst,
and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during
the day, and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of
medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval
adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually
hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself
to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud, when my captain offered
me the second dignity in the vessel,
and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so valuable did
he consider my services.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
My life might have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some
encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my
spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult
voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am
required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain
my own, when theirs are failing.
