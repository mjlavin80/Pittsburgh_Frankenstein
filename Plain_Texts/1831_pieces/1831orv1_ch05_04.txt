I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily
exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the
streets, without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was doing.
My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on with
irregular steps, not daring to look about me:--

Like one who, on a lonely road,
   Doth walk in fear and dread,
And, having once turned round, walks on,
   And turns no more his head;
Because he knows a frightful fiend
   Doth close behind him tread.*

Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;
but I remained some minutes with my
eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of
the street. As it drew nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just where I was
standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,
instantly sprung out. "My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed he, "how glad I am
to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my
alighting!"
