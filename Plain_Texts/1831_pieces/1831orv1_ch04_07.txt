The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a
most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful
harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to the charms of
nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around
me caused me also to forget those
friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so
long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well remembered the
words of my father: "I know that while you are pleased with yourself, you
will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You
must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a
proof that your other duties are
equally neglected."

I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings; but I could not
tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my
imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my
feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every
habit of my nature, should be completed.
