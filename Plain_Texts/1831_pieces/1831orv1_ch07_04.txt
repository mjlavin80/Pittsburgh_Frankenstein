Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this
letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded to
the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my friends. I
threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.

"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
weep with bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy? My dear
friend, what has happened?"

I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up
and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed
from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my
misfortune.

"I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he; "your
disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?"

"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the
horses."

During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he
could only express his heartfelt sympathy. "Poor William!" said he,
"dear lovely child, he now sleeps with
his angel mother! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young
beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel
the murderer's grasp! How much more a murderer, that could destroy such
radiance innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his
friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his
sufferings are at an end for ever.  A sod covers his gentle form, and he
knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve
that for his miserable survivors."
