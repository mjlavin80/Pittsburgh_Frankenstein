We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a
boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping
for London. During this voyage, we passed many willowy islands, and saw
several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth from our
departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below
Mayence becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly, and
winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw
many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,
presents a singularly variegated
landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles
overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath;
and, on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards, with green
sloping banks, and a meandering river, and populous towns occupy the
scene.
