"Devil!" I exclaimed, "do you dare
approach me? and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on
your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! or rather stay,
that I may trample you to dust! and, oh! that I could, with the extinction
of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so
diabolically murdered!"

"I expected this reception," said the d√¶mon. "All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be
hated, who am miserable beyond all
living things! Yet you, my
creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the
annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do
mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my
conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will
glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your
remaining friends."

"Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too mild a
vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! you reproach me with your
creation; come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so
negligently bestowed." My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him,
impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence
of another.
