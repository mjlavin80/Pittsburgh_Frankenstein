After passing some months in London, we received a letter
from a person in Scotland, who had formerly been our visitor at
Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country, and
asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to
prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval
eagerly desired to accept this invitation; and I, although I
abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams, and
all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
dwelling-places.

We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now
February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the
north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not
intend to follow the great road to
Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive
at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed up my
chemical instruments, and the materials I had collected, resolving to
finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of
Scotland.

We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days
at Windsor, rambling in its
beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the
majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately
deer, were all novelties to us.
