"Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they
entered into conversation, using violent
gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke
the language of the country, which
differed from that of my protectors.
Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man: I was surprised,
as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited
anxiously to discover, from his discourse, the meaning of these unusual
appearances.

"'Do you consider,' said his
companion to him, 'that you will be obliged to pay three months' rent,
and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair
advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of
your determination.'

"'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix, 'we can never again inhabit your
cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the
dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover
their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take
possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this place.'

"Felix trembled violently as he
said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they
remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.
