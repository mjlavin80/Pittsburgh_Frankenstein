On hearing this information, I suffered a temporary access of
despair. He had escaped me; and I must commence a destructive and
almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the
ocean, -- amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long
endure, and which I, the native
of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet
at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage
and vengeance returned, and, like a mighty tide, overwhelmed
every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead
hovered round, and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared
for my journey.

I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the
inequalities of the Frozen Ocean; and purchasing a plentiful
stock of provisions, I departed from land.

I cannot guess how many days have
passed since then; but I have endured misery, which nothing but the
eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have
enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up
my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my
destruction. But again the frost came, and made the paths of the sea
secure.
