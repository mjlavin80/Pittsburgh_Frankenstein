"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man,
indeed, at once so powerful, so
virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one
time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at another, as all that can
be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared
the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and
vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a
condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a
long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his
fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard
details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with
disgust and loathing.

"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I
listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was
explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth
and squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and
noble blood.

"The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the
possessions most esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and
unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only
one of these advantages; but, without either, he was considered, except in
very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits
of the chosen few. And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was
absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I
possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,
endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of
the same nature as man. I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon
coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my
frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around, I saw and
heard of none like me. Was I then a
monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled, and whom all
men disowned?
