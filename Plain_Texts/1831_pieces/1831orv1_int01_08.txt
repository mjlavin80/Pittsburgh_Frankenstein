Every thing must have a beginning, to speak in Sanchean phrase;
and that beginning must be linked to something that went before.
The Hindoos give the world an elephant to support it, but they
make the elephant stand upon a
tortoise. Invention, it must be
humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but
out of chaos; the materials must, in the first place, be
afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless substances, but
cannot bring into being the substance itself.  In all matters of
discovery and invention, even of those that appertain to the
imagination, we are continually reminded of the story of Columbus
and his egg.  Invention consists in the capacity of seizing on
the capabilities of a subject, and in the power of moulding and
fashioning ideas suggested to it.
