"How inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by my
representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I
swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that,
with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man, and
dwell as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions
will have fled, for I shall meet with
sympathy! my life will flow quietly away, and, in my dying moments, I
shall not curse my maker."

His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and
sometimes felt a wish to console him; but when I looked upon him, when I
saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my
feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I
thought, that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to
withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power
to bestow.

"You swear," I said, "to be harmless; but have you not
already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me
distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase
your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge."

"How is this?  I must not be trifled with: and I demand an answer.
If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice
must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my
crimes, and I shall become a thing, of whose existence every one will be
ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my
virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I
shall feel the affections of a sensitive
being, and become linked to the chain
of existence and events, from which I am now excluded."
