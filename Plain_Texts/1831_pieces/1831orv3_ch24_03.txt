I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded; but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the
moon arose, and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted
shape, as he fled with more than mortal speed.

I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task. Guided
by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but
vainly. The blue Mediterranean
appeared; and, by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by
night, and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I
took my passage in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not
how.

Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still
evaded me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the
peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his
path; sometimes he himself, who
feared that if I lost all trace of him, I should despair and die,
left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head,
and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering on life,
to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how can you understand
what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were
the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and
carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and
directed my steps, and, when I most murmured, would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.
Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the
exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert, that
restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as
the peasants of the country ate; but I will not doubt that it was
set there by the spirits that
I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens
cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would
bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.
