His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of the
horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards
the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. 
The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountains, and fixing
my feet firmly as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied as I was by the
emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far
advanced, when I came to the half-way resting-place, and seated myself
beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals, as the clouds passed
from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a
broken tree lay on the ground: it was a
scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange thoughts within me. 
I wept bitterly; and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, "Oh! stars and clouds, and winds, ye are
all about to mock me: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory;
let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in
darkness."

These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how
the eternal twinkling of the stars
weighed upon me, and how I listened to every blast of wind, as if it
were a dull ugly siroc on its way to
consume me.
