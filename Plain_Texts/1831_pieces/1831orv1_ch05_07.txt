"My dear Victor," cried he, "what, for God's sake, is the
matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the
cause of all this?"

"Do not ask me," cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I
saw the dreaded spectre glide into
the room; "he can tell. -- Oh, save me! save me!" I imagined that
the
monster seized me; I struggled
furiously, and fell down in a fit.

Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he
anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was
not the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my
senses for a long, long time.

This was the commencement of a nervous
fever, which confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards
learned that, knowing my father's advanced age, and unfitness for so long a journey, and
how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief
by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a
more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt
of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the
kindest action that he could towards them.

But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and
unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the
monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and
I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry: he
at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but the
pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject,
persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and
terrible event.
