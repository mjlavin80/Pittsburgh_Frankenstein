I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the
daemon generally avoided these, as it was here that the
population of the country chiefly collected. In other places
human beings were seldom seen; and I generally subsisted on the wild
animals that crossed my path. I had money with me, and
gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or
I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking
a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me
with fire and utensils for cooking.

My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it
was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep!
often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams
lulled me even to rapture. The
spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather
hours, of happiness, that I might retain strength to fulfil my
pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my
hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the
hope of night: for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my
beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my
father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and
beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by
a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
come, and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my
dearest friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! how
did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even
my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At
such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart,
and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the daemon, more
as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of
some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.
