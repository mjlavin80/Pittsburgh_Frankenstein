Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on
the wide ocean, nor even here in
Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the
dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant,
for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory: or rather, to word my phrase more
characteristically, of advancement in
his profession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and
professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the
noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on
board a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I
easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.
