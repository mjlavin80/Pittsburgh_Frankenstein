This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as
we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this
apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so
distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was
impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
greatest attention.

About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice broke, and freed
our ship. We, however, lay to until
the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses
which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this
time to rest for a few hours.

In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon the deck,
and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a 
human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the 
vessel. He was not, as the other traveller 
seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but 
an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, "Here is our 
captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea."

On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. "Before I come on board
your vessel," said he, "will you have the kindness to inform me whither
you are bound?"
