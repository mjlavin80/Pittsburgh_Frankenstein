"The volume of 'Plutarch's Lives,' which I possessed, contained the
histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a
far different effect upon me from the 'Sorrows of Werter.' I learned
from Werter's imaginations despondency
and gloom: but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above
the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes
of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and
experience. I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of
country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was perfectly
unacquainted with towns, and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my
protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature;
but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men
concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt
the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
far as I understood the signification of
those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and
pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire
peaceable law givers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to
Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal
lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on
my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a
young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued
with different sensations.
