At first I thought but of a few pages of a short tale; but Shelley urged me to
develope the idea at greater length.  I
certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of
one train of feeling, to my husband, and yet but for his incitement, it
would never have taken the form in which it was presented.  From this
declaration I must except the preface.  As far as I can recollect, it was
entirely written by him.

And now, once again, I bid my hideous
progeny go forth and prosper.  I have an affection for it, for it was
the offspring of happy days, when death and grief were but words, which
found no true echo in my heart.  Its several pages speak of many a walk,
many a drive, and many a conversation, when I was not alone; and my
companion was one who, in this world, I shall never see more.  But this is
for myself; my readers have nothing to do with these associations.
