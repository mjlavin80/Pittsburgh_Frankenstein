This address caused a considerable
change in the physiognomy of
my own auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that
is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when
he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole
tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly,
"I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the
creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put
all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can
traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and dens where no man
would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since
the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what
place he has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit."

"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and
if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like
the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive
your thoughts: you do not
credit my narrative, and do not intend to pursue my enemy
with the punishment which is his desert."

As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was
intimidated: -- "You are mistaken," said he, "I will exert
myself; if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured
that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But
I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his
properties, that this will prove impracticable, and thus, while
every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to
disappointment."
