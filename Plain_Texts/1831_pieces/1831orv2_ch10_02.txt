The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to
surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically
desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be
perceived, where trees lie broken and
strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon
the jutting rocks of the mountain, or transversely upon other trees. The
path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which
stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous,
as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a
concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the
speaker. The pines are not tall or
luxuriant, but they are sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene. I
looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which
ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured
from the dark sky, and added to the melancholy impression I received from
the objects around me. Alas! why does man boast of sensibilities superior to
those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.
If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we
are moved by every wind that blows, and a chance word or scene that that
word may convey to us. 

We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
   We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.
We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
   Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
   The path of its departure still is free.
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
   Nought may endure but mutability!
