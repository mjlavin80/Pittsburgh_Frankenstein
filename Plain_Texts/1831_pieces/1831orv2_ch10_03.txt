It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.
For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.
A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently
a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.
The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled
sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.
The field of ice is almost a league 
in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite
mountain is a bare
perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert
was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it
rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the
rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or
rather the vast river of ice, wound 
among its dependent mountains, whose aÃ«rial summits hung over its
recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the
clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something
like joy; I exclaimed -- "Wandering 
spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow
me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys
of life."

As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices
in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as
he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came
over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly restored
by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer,
(sight tremendous and abhorred!) that
it was the wretch whom I had
created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach,
and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter
anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly
ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely
observed this; rage and hatred had at
first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with
words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.
