"My travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was <a
href="../V2notes/autumn.html">late in autumn</a> when I quitted the
district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful
of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and
the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers
were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard, and chill, and bare, and I
found no shelter. <a href="../V2notes/earth.html">Oh, earth!</a> how often
did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature
had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer
I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of
revenge <a href="../V2notes/enkindle.html">enkindled</a> in my heart. Snow
fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now
and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often
wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no
respite: no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not
extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the
confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth, and the
earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the
bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p><p>

"I generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was secured
by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path
lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun
had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me
by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt
emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive
within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed
myself to be borne away by them; and, forgetting my 
solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.  <a 
href="../V2notes/softtear.html">Soft tears</a> again bedewed my
cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the
blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me.</p>
