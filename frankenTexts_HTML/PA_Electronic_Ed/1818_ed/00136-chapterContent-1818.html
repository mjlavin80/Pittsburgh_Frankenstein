"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed
the ground, and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth,
Safie, Agatha, and Felix, departed on a long country walk, and the
old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. When
his children had departed, he took up his guitar, and played
several mournful, but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I
had ever heard him play before. At first his countenance was
illuminated with pleasure, but, as he continued, thoughtfulness
and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he
sat absorbed in reflection.</p><p>

"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial,
which would decide my hopes, or realize my fears. The servants
were gone to a neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around
the cottage: it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I
proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me, and I sunk to
the ground. Again I rose; and, exerting all the firmness of which
I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my
hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and, with
renewed determination, I approached the door of their cottage.</p><p>

"I knocked. 'Who is there?' said the old man -- 'Come in.'</p><p>

"I entered; '<a href="../V2notes/pardon.html">Pardon this intrusion</a>,'
said I, 'I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly
oblige me, if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the
fire.'</p><p>

"'Enter,' said De Lacey; 'and I will try in what manner I can relieve your
wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and, as I
am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food
for you.'</p>
