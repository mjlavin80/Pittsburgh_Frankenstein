<h2 >CHAPTER VII.</h2> 
"S<small>UCH</small> was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues, and to deprecate the vices of mankind.</p><p> 
"As yet <a href="../V2notes/evil.html">I looked upon crime as a distant evil</a>; benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. But, in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.</p><p> 
"One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood, where I collected my own food, and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern <a href="../V2notes/port.html">portmanteau</a>, containing several articles of dress and some <a href="../V2notes/books.html">books</a>. I eagerly seized the prize, and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were <a href="../V2notes/language.html">written in the language</a> the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of <a href="../V2notes/pl.html"><i>Paradise Lost</i></a>, a volume of <a href="../V2notes/plutarch.html"><i>Plutarch's Lives</i></a>, and the <a href="../V2notes/werter.html"><i>Sorrows of Werter</i></a>. The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.</p>
