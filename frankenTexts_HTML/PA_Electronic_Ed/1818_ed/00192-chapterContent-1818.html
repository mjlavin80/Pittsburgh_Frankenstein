My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare, and
endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my
heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a
prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness. "What a place is this
that you inhabit, my son!" said he, looking mournfully at the
barred windows, and wretched appearance of the room. "You
travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you.
And poor Clerval--"</p><p>

The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an
agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.</p><p>

"Alas! yes, my father," replied I; "<a
href="../V3notes/somedest.html">some destiny</a> of the most
horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfill it, or
surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry."</p><p>

We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for
the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution
necessary that could insure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in, and
insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much
exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like that of
my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.</p><p>

As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and <a
href="../V3notes/blackmel.html">black melancholy</a>, that
nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for ever before
me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which
these reflections threw me made <a
href="../V3notes/myfriend.html">my friends</a> dread a dangerous
relapse. Alas! why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
life? It was surely that I might fulfill <a
href="../V3notes/mydest.html">my destiny, which is now drawing to
a close</a>. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
throbbings, and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that
bears me to the dust; and, in executing <a
href="../V3notes/award.html">the award of justice</a>, I shall
also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant,
although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often
sat for hours motionless and speechless, <a
href="../V3notes/somerev.html">wishing for some mighty
revolution</a> that might bury me and my destroyer in its
ruins.</p>
