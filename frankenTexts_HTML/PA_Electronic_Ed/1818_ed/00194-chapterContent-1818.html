I remember, as I quitted the prison, I heard one of the men
say, "He may be innocent of the murder, but he has certainly <a
href="../V3notes/badcons.html">a bad conscience</a>."  These
words struck me.  A bad conscience! yes, surely I had one.
William, Justine, and Clerval, had died through my infernal
machinations; "And whose death," cried I, "is to finish the
tragedy?  Ah! my father, do not remain in this wretched country;
take me where I may forget myself, my existence, and all the
world."</p><p>

My father easily acceded to my desire; and, after having
taken leave of Mr. Kirwin, we hastened to <a
href="../Places/dublin.html">Dublin</a>. I felt as if I
was relieved from a heavy weight, when the packet sailed with a
fair wind from Ireland, and I had quitted for ever the country
which had been to me the scene of so much misery.</p><p>

It was midnight. My father slept in the cabin; and I lay on
the deck, looking at the stars, and listening to the dashing of
the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight,
and my pulse beat with <a href="../V3notes/feverish.html">a
feverish joy</a>, when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva.
The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet
the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the
detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told
me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision, and that
Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to
me and <a href="../V3notes/monster.html">the monster of my
creation</a>. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet
happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of
my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered
shuddering at <a href="../V3notes/madenthu.html">the mad
enthusiasm</a> that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous
enemy, and I called to mind the night during which he first
lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand
feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.</p><p>

Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of
taking every night <a href="../V3notes/laudanum.html">a small
quantity of laudanum</a>; for it was by means of this drug only
that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the
preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various
misfortunes, I now took a double dose, and soon slept profoundly.
But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my
dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me. <a
href="../V3notes/morning.html">Towards morning I was possessed by
a kind of night-mare</a>; I felt the fiend's grasp in my neck,
and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rung in my
ears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my
restlessness, awoke me, and pointed to the port of <a
href="../Places/holyhead.html">Holyhead</a>, which
we were now entering.</p>
