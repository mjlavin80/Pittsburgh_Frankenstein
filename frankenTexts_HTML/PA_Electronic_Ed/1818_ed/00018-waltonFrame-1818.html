You may conceive my <a href="../V1notes/astonish.html">astonishment</a> on hearing
such a question
addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to
whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a
resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious
wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on
a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.</p><p>

Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to
come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who
thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been
boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully
emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so
wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin;
but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he <a
href="../V1notes/fainted.html">fainted</a>. We
accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to
animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow
a small quantity. As soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped
him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the
kitchen-stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little
soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p><p>

Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak;
and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of
understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed
him to my own cabin, and <a href="../V1notes/attended.html">attended on him</a> as
much as my duty would
permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have
generally an expression of wildness, and even <a
href="../V1notes/madness.html">madness</a>; but there
are moments when, if any-one performs an act of kindness towards
him, or does him any the most trifling service, his whole
countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence
and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally
melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he <a href="../V1notes/gnashes.html">gnashes
his teeth</a>, as
if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>
