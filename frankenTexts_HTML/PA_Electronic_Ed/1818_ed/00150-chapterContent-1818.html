<h2 >CHAPTER IX.</h2> 
T<small>HE</small> <a href="../V2notes/being.html">being</a> finished speaking, and fixed his looks upon me in expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued--</p><p> 
"You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of those <a href="../V2notes/sympnec.html">sympathies necessary for my being</a>.  This you alone can do; and I demand it of you <a href="../V2notes/right.html">as a right</a> which you must not refuse."</p><p> 
The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and, as he said this, <a href="../V2notes/rage.html">I could no longer suppress the rage</a> that burned within me.</p><p> 
"I do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent."</p>
