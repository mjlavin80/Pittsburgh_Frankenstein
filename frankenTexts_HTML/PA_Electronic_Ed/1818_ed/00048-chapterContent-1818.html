No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me
onwards, like a hurricane, in the first <a
href="../V1notes/enthus1.html">enthusiasm</a> of success. Life
and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break
through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new
species would bless me as its <a
href="../V1notes/creator.html">creator and source</a>; many happy
and excellent natures would owe their being to me. <a
href="../V1notes/nopap.html">No father could claim the gratitude
of his child</a> so completely as I should deserve <a
href="../V1notes/theirs.html">their's</a>. Pursuing these
reflections, I thought, that if I could bestow animation upon
lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found
it impossible) <a href="../V1notes/renew.html">renew life</a>
where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.</p><p>

These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my
undertaking with <a href="../V1notes/unremit.html">unremitting
ardour</a>. My cheek had grown pale with study, and <a
href="../V1notes/emaciate.html">my person had become emaciated
with confinement</a>. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty,
I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the
next hour might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was
the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on
my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall
conceive the horrors of my secret toil, as I dabbled among the
unhallowed damps of the grave, or <a
href="../V1notes/tortured.html">tortured the living animal</a> to
animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim
with the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost frantic
impulse, urged me forward; <a href="../V1notes/lostsoul.html">I
seemed to have lost all soul or sensation</a> but for this one
pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me
feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus
ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected
bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers,
the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber,
or rather cell, at the top of the <a
href="../Gifs/tower.html">house</a>, and separated from all the
other apartments by a <a
href="../V1notes/gallery.html">gallery</a> and staircase, I kept
<a href="../V1notes/workshop.html">my workshop of filthy
creation</a>; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in
attending to the details of my employment. The <a
href="../V1notes/dissect.html">dissecting room</a> and the <a
href="../V1notes/slaughtr.html">slaughter-house</a> furnished
many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with
loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an
eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to
a conclusion.</p>
