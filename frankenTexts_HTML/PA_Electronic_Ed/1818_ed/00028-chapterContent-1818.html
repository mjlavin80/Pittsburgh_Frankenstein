From this time <a href="../V1notes/elizabet.html">Elizabeth Lavenza</a>
became my playfellow, and, as we grew older, my friend.  She was docile
and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect.  Although she
was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her
disposition uncommonly affectionate.  No one could better enjoy liberty,
yet no one could submit with more grace than she did to constraint and
caprice.  Her imagination was luxuriant, yet her capability of application
was great.  Her person was the image of her mind; her hazel eyes, although
as lively as a bird's, possessed an attractive softness.  Her figure was
light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she
appeared the most fragile creature in the world.  While I admired her
understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should on a
favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind
united to so little pretension.</p><p>

Every one adored Elizabeth.  If the servants had any request to make, it
was always through her intercession.  We were strangers to any species of
disunion and dispute; for although there was <a
href="../V1notes/greatdis.html">a great dissimilitude in our
characters</a>, there was an harmony in that very dissimilitude.  I was
more calm and philosophical than my companion; yet my temper was not so
yielding.  My application was of longer endurance; but it was not so
severe whilst it endured.  I delighted in <a
href="../V1notes/investig.html">investigating the facts</a> relative to
the actual world; she busied herself in following the aÃ«rial <a
href="../V1notes/creation.html">creations of the poets</a>.  The world was
to me a secret, which I desired to discover; to her it was a <a
href="../V1notes/vacancy.html">vacancy</a>, which she sought to people
with imaginations of her own.</p>
