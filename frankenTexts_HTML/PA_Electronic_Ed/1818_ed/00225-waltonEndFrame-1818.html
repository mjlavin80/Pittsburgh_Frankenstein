"I thank you, Walton," he said, "for your kind intentions towards <a href="../V3notes/miserabl.html">so miserable a wretch</a>; but  when you speak of new  ties, and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was; or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where <a href="../V3notes/affect.html">the affections</a>  are not strongly  moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds, which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. <a href="../V3notes/sister.html">A  sister or a brother</a> can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shewn early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be invaded with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and, wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth, and the conversation of Clerval, will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead; and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfill it. But <a href="../V3notes/mydestin.html">such is not my  destiny</a>; I must  pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled, and I may die."</p>
