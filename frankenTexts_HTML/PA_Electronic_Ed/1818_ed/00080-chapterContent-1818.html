<h2 >CHAPTER VII.</h2> 
W<small>E</small> passed a few sad hours, until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched <a href="../V1notes/mockery.html">mockery of justice</a>, I suffered living torture. <a href="../V1notes/wasdecid.html">It was to be decided</a>, whether the result of my <a href="../V1notes/curiosit.html">curiosity</a> and <a href="../V1notes/lawless.html">lawless devices</a> would cause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of innocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave; and <a href="../V1notes/thecause.html">I the cause!</a> A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the <a href="../V1notes/ravings.html">ravings of a madman</a>, and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.</p><p> 
The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although <a href="../V1notes/gazed.html">gazed on and execrated</a> by thousands; for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.</p>
