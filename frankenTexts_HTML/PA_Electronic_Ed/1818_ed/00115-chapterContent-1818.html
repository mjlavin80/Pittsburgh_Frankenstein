"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not
rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.
<a href="../V2notes/thisfreq.html">This frequently took place</a>; but a
high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant
than it had been.</p><p>

"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended
the motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various
occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my
friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the
night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food and
fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I
cleared their path of the snow, and performed those offices that I had
seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an
invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them,
on these occasions, utter the words <a
href="../V2notes/goodspir.html"><i>good spirit</i></a>, <i>wonderful</i>;
but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.</p><p>

"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives
and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why
Felix appeared so miserable, and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish
wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these
deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the venerable
blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix, flitted before
me. I looked upon them as superior beings, who would be the <a
href="../V2notes/arbiters.html">arbiters of my future destiny</a>. I
formed in <a href="../V2notes/myimag.html">my imagination</a> a thousand
pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I
imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and
conciliating words, I should first win their favour, and afterwards their
love.</p>
