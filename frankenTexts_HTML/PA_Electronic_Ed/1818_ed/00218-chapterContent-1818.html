My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these
scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose; and,
calling on heaven to support me, I continued with unabated
fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a
distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! how
unlike it was to <a href="../V3notes/blueseas.html">the blue seas
of the south</a>! Covered with ice, it was only to be
distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness.
<a href="../V3notes/greeks.html">The Greeks wept for joy</a> when
they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed
with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep; but I
knelt down, and, with a full heart, thanked <a
href="../V3notes/guidspir.html">my guiding spirit</a> for
conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped,
notwithstanding my adversary's gibe, to meet and grapple with
him.</p><p>

Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and
dogs, and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I
know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages; but I
found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I
now gained on him, so much so, that when I first saw the ocean,
he was but one day's journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept
him before he should reach the beach. With new courage,
therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
hamlet on the sea-shore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning
the fiend, and gained accurate information. <a
href="../V3notes/gigantic.html">A gigantic monster</a>, they
said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many
pistols; putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage,
through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their
store of winter food, and, placing it in a sledge, to draw which
he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had
harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the
horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea
in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he
must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice, or frozen
by the eternal frosts.</p>
