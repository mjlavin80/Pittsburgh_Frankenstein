"She indeed requires consolation; she accused herself of
having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very
wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered--"</p><p>

"<a href="../V1notes/murdiscd.html">The murderer discovered!</a> Good God!
how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? it is impossible; one
might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with
a straw."</p><p>

"I do not know what you mean; but we were all very unhappy when she was
discovered.  No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will
not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would
credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the 
family, could all at once become so <a
href="../V1notes/allat.html">extremely wicked</a>?"</p><p>

"Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it
is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely,
Ernest?"</p><p>

"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out,
that have almost forced conviction upon us: and her own behaviour
has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight
that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried
to-day, and you will then hear all."</p><p>

He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor
William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and
confined to her bed; and, after several days, one
of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on
the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture
of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the
murderer. The servant instantly shewed it to one of the others,
who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a
magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.
On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the
suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.</p>
