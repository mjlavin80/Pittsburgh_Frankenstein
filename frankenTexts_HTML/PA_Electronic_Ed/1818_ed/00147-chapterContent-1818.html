"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure
the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I
knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I
had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the
oppressive sense of the <a href="../V2notes/injust.html">injustice</a>
and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge -- <a
href="../V2notes/deeprev.html">a deep and deadly revenge</a>, such as
would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.</p><p>

"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours
I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle
breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted <a
href="../V2notes/desolate.html">my desolate state</a>, and made me feel
more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.</p><p>

"But my toils now drew near a close; and, two months from this time, I
reached the environs of Geneva.</p><p>

"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the
fields that surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply to you.
I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the
gentle breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting behind the
stupendous mountains of Jura.</p><p>

"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running
into the recess I had chosen with all the <a 
href="../V2notes/sportive.html">sportiveness of infancy</a>.
Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this little creature
was unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror
of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him, and educate him as my
companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled
earth.</p>
