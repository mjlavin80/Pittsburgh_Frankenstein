<h2 >CHAPTER V.</h2> 
W<small>E</small> had resolved not to go to London, but to cross the country to <a href="../V3notes/portsmou.html">Portsmouth</a>, and thence to embark for <a href="../V3notes/havre.html">Havre</a>.  I preferred this plan principally because I dreaded to see again those places in which I had enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved Clerval.  I thought with horror of seeing again those persons whom we had been accustomed to visit together, and who might make <a href="../V3notes/inquiry.html">inquiries concerning an event</a>, the very remembrance of which made me again feel the pang I endured when I gazed on his lifeless form in the inn at ----.</p><p> 
As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again seeing me restored to health and peace of mind.  His tenderness and attentions were unremitting; my grief and gloom was obstinate, but he would not despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.</p><p> 
"Alas! my father," said I, "<a href="../V3notes/howlit.html">how little do you know me</a>. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this -- I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry -- <a href="../V3notes/myhands.html">they all died by my hands</a>."</p><p> 
My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as caused by delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation, and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a feeling that <a href="../V3notes/mad.html">I should be supposed mad</a>, and this for ever chained my tongue, when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet still words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them; but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.</p>
