I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some
time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my
mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to arrive at some
conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my
cousin was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn
promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and dared not break; or,
if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my
devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this <a
href="../V3notes/neck.html">deadly weight yet hanging round my
neck</a>, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my
engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate, before I
allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an union from which I
expected peace.</p><p>

I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either
journeying to England, or entering into a long correspondence
with those philosophers of that country, whose knowledge and
discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present
undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired
intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory: besides, any
variation was agreeable to me, and I was delighted with the idea
of spending a year or two in change of scene and variety of
occupation, <a href="../V3notes/family.html">in absence from my
family</a>; during which period some event might happen which
would restore me to them in peace and happiness:  my promise
might be fulfilled, and the monster have departed; or some
accident might occur to destroy him, and put an end to <a
href="../V3notes/slavery.html">my slavery</a> for ever.</p><p>

These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a
wish to visit England; but, <a
href="../V3notes/truereas.html">concealing the true reasons</a>
of this request, I clothed my desires under the guise of wishing
to travel and see the world before I sat down for life within the
walls of my native town.</p>
