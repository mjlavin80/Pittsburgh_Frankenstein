He easily eluded me, and said,</p><p>

"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to
your hatred on <a href="../V2notes/devoted.html">my devoted head</a>. Have I not
suffered enough, that
you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an
accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.
Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height
is superior to thine; my joints more supple. But I will not be
tempted to <a href="../V2notes/nottempt.html">set myself in opposition</a> to thee. I am
thy creature,
and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king,
if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh,
Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and trample upon
me alone, to whom <a href="../V2notes/thyjust.html">thy justice</a>, and even thy
clemency and
affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature: <a href="../V2notes/iought.html">I
ought
to be thy Adam</a>; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
drivest from joy for no misdeed. Every where I see bliss, from
which I alone am irrevocably excluded. <a href="../V2notes/wasbene.html">I was
benevolent</a> and good;
<a href="../V2notes/misery.html">misery made me a fiend</a>. Make me happy, and I shall
again be
virtuous."</p><p>

"Begone! I will not hear you. <a href="../V2notes/nocommun.html">There can be no
community</a>
between you and me; we are <a href="../V2notes/enemies.html">enemies</a>. Begone,
or let us <a href="../V2notes/letustry.html">try our
strength</a> in a fight, in which one must fall."</p>
