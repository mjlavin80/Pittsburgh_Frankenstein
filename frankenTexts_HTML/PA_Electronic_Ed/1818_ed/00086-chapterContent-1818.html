"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also <a
href="../V1notes/joinenem.html">join with my enemies</a> to crush me?" Her
voice was suffocated with sobs.</p><p>

"Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth, "why do you kneel, if you
are innocent? I am not one of your enemies; I believed you
guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you
had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false;
and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my
confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession."</p><p>

"I did confess; but I confessed a lie. 
<a href="../V1notes/iconfessd.html">I confessed</a>, that I might
obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my
heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever
since I was condemned, <a href="../V1notes/confessr.html">my confessor 
has besieged me</a>; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began
to think that <a href="../V1notes/ialmost.html">I was
the monster</a> that he said I was. He threatened excommunication and
hell fire in my last moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady,
I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to
ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour <a
href="../V1notes/subscrib.html">I subscribed to a lie</a>; and now
only am I truly miserable."</p><p>

She paused, weeping, and then continued -- "I thought with
horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom
your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was
a creature capable of a crime which <a href="../V1notes/nonebut.html">none but the
devil</a> himself
could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I
soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy;
and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and
death."</p>
