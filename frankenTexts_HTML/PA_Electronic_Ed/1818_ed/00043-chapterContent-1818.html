<h2 >CHAPTER III.</h2> 
F<small>ROM</small> this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with <a href="../V1notes/ardour.html">ardour</a> those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures, and cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the university; and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive <a href="../V1notes/physiogn.html">physiognomy</a> and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.  It was, perhaps, the amiable character of this man that inclined me more to that branch of natural philosophy which he professed, than an intrinsic love for the science itself.  But this state of mind had place only in the first steps towards knowledge:  the more fully I entered into the science, the more exclusively I <a href="../V1notes/pursued.html">pursued it for its own sake</a>. That application, which at first had been a matter of <a href="../V1notes/duty.html">duty</a> and resolution, now became so ardent and eager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>
