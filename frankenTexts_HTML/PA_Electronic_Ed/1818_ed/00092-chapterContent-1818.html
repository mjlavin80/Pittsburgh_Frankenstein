Our house was the house of mourning. My father's health was deeply shaken
by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she
no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to
her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was
the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She
was <a href="../V2notes/nolonger.html">no longer that happy creature</a>,
who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake, and talked
with ecstasy of our future prospects.  She had become grave, and often
conversed of the inconstancy of fortune, and the instability of human
life.</p><p>

"When I reflect, my dear cousin," said she, "on the miserable death of
Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before
appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice,
that I read in books or heard from others, as tales of ancient days, or
imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more familiar to reason
than to <a href="../V2notes/imagine.html">the imagination</a>; but now
misery has come home, and men appear to me as <a
href="../V2notes/monsters.html">monsters thirsting for each other's
blood</a>. Yet I am certainly unjust. Every body believed that poor girl
to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she
suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human
creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her
benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and
appeared to love as if it had been her own! <a
href="../V2notes/notconsnt.html">I could not consent to the death</a> of
any human being; but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit
to remain in the society of men. Yet she was innocent. <a
href="../V2notes/knowfeel.html">I know, I feel</a> she was innocent; you
are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, <a
href="../V2notes/whenfals.html">when falsehood can look so like the
truth</a>, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel if I
were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are
crowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and
Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the
world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer
on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with <a
href="../V2notes/suchwret.html">such a wretch</a>."</p>
