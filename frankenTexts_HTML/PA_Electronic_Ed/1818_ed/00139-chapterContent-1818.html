"'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips <a
href="../V2notes/first.html">first have I heard the voice of kindness</a>

torn him limb from limb, as a lion rends the antelope. But my heart sunk
within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point
of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the
cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.</p>
