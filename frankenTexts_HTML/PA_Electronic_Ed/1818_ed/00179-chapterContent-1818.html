I walked about the isle like <a href="../V3notes/restspec.html">a restless
spectre</a>, separated from all it loved, and miserable in the separation.
When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass, and
was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the
preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching
and misery. The sleep into which I now sunk refreshed me; and when I
awoke, I again felt as if <a href="../V3notes/race2.html">I belonged to a
race of
human beings</a> like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed
with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rung in my ears
like a death-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and
oppressive as a reality.</p><p>

The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore,
satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten
cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the
men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and
one from Clerval, entreating me to join him. He said that <a
href="../V3notes/nearyear.html">nearly a year had elapsed</a>
since we had quitted Switzerland, and France was yet unvisited.
He entreated me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle, and meet
him at Perth, in a week from that time, when we might arrange the
plan of our future proceedings.  This letter in a degree recalled
me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration
of two days.</p><p>

Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which
I shuddered to reflect: I must pack my chemical instruments; and
for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene
of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils, the sight of
which was sickening to me. The next morning, at day-break, I
summoned sufficient courage, and unlocked the door of my
laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had
destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and <a
href="../V3notes/almost.html">I almost felt as if I had mangled
the living flesh of a human being</a>. I paused to collect
myself, and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I
conveyed the instruments out of the room; but I reflected that I
ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and
suspicion of the peasants, and I accordingly put them into a
basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up,
determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the
mean time I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and
arranging my chemical apparatus.</p>
