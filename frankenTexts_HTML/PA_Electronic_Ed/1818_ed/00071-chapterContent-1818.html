Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this
letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded to
the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my friends. I
threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.</p><p>

"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
weep with bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy? My dear
friend, what has happened?"</p><p>

I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up
and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed
from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my
misfortune.</p><p>

"I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he; "your
disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?"</p><p>

"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the
horses."</p><p>

During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to raise my spirits.  He did not do
this by common topics of consolation, but by exhibiting the truest <a
href="../V1notes/sympathy.html">sympathy</a>.  "Poor William!" said
he, "that dear child; he now <a href="../V1notes/sleeps.html">sleeps with
his angel mother</a>.  His friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest:  he
does not now feel the murderer's grasp; a sod covers his gentle form, and
he knows no pain. He can no longer be a fit subject for pity; the
survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the only
consolation.  Those maxims of the <a
href="../V1notes/stoics.html">Stoics</a>, that death was no evil, and that
the mind of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of
a beloved object, ought not to be urged.  Even <a
href="../V1notes/catowept.html">Cato wept</a> over the dead body of his
brother."</p>
