<p>C<small>LERVAL</small> then put the following letter into my hands.</p> 
<p><center><i>To</i> V. F<small>RANKENSTEIN</small>.</center></p><p> 
"<small>MY DEAR COUSIN</small>,</p><p> 
"I cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt concerning your health.  We cannot help imagining that your friend Clerval conceals the extent of your disorder:  for it is now several months since we have seen your hand-writing; and all this time you have been obliged to dictate your letters to Henry. Surely, Victor, you must have been exceedingly ill; and this makes us all very wretched, as much so nearly as after the death of your dear mother.  My uncle was almost persuaded that you were indeed dangerously ill, and could hardly be restrained from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.  Clerval always writes that you are getting better; I eagerly hope that you will <a href="../V1notes/youwill.html">confirm this intelligence soon in your own hand-writing</a>; for indeed, indeed, Victor, we are all very miserable on this account.  Relieve us from this fear, and we shall be the happiest creatures in the world.  <a href="../V1notes/papheal.html">Your father's health</a> is now so vigorous, that he appears ten years younger since last winter. <a href="../V1notes/ernest.html">Ernest</a> also is so much improved, that you would hardly know him:  he is now nearly sixteen, and has lost that sickly appearance which he had some years ago; he is grown quite robust and active.</p>
