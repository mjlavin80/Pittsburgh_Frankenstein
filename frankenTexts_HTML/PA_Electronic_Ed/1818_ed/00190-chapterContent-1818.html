"That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events,
become the <a href="../V3notes/mostmis.html">most miserable of
mortals</a>. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can
death be any evil to me?"</p><p>

"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than <a
href="../V3notes/strchanc.html">the strange chances that have
lately occurred</a>. You were thrown, by some surprising
accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality: seized
immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was
presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in
so unaccountable a manner, and placed, as it were, by some fiend
across your path."</p><p>

As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I
endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt
considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess
concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my
countenance; for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say--</p><p>

"It was not until a day or two after your illness that I thought
of examining your dress, that I might discover some trace by
which <a href="../V3notes/icould.html">I could send to your
relations an account of your misfortune and illness</a>. I found
several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from
its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to
Geneva: nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my
letter. -- But you are ill; even now you tremble: you are unfit
for agitation of any kind."</p><p>

"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most
horrible event: tell me what new scene of death has been acted,
and whose murder I am now to lament."</p><p>

"Your family is perfectly well," said Mr. Kirwin, with
gentleness; "and some one, a friend, is come to visit you."</p>
