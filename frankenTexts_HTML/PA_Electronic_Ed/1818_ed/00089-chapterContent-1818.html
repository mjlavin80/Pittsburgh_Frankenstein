Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in
a voice of half-suppressed emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady,
dearest Elizabeth, <a href="../V1notes/mybelovd.html">my beloved
and only friend</a>; may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve
you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer.
Live, and be happy, and <a href="../V1notes/makeothr.html">make
others so</a>."</p><p>

As we returned, Elizabeth said, "You know not, my dear Victor,
how much I am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this
unfortunate girl.  I never could again have known peace, if I had
been deceived in my reliance on her.  For the moment that I did
believe her guilty, I felt an anguish that I could not have long
sustained.  Now my heart is lightened.  The innocent suffers; but
she whom I thought amiable and good has not betrayed the trust I
reposed in her, and I am consoled."</p><p>

Amiable cousin! such were your thoughts, mild and gentle as your
own dear eyes and voice.  But I -- <a
href="../V1notes/iwasawre.html">I was a wretch</a>, and <a
href="../V1notes/noneever.html">none ever conceived of the
misery</a> that I then endured.</p>
