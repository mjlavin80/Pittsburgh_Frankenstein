Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense
I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed
like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and <a
href="../V3notes/teargush.html">tears gushed from my eyes</a>.</p><p>

How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that
clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery! I
constructed another sail with a part of my dress, and eagerly
steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky
appearance; but, as I approached nearer, I easily perceived the
traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore, and found
myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of
civilized man. I eagerly traced the windings of the land, and
hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a
small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I
resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where I
could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money
with me. As I turned the promontory, I perceived a small neat
town and a good harbour, which I entered, my <a
href="../V3notes/heart.html">heart bounding with joy at my
unexpected escape</a>.</p><p>

As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
people crowded towards the spot. They seemed very much surprised at my
appearance; but, instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together
with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight
sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English;
and I therefore addressed them in <a href="../V3notes/language.html">that
language</a>:  "My good friends," said I, "will you be so kind as to tell
me the name of this town, and inform me where I am?"</p><p>

"You will know that soon enough," replied a man with a gruff
voice. "May be you are come to a place that will not prove much
to your taste; but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I
promise you."</p>
