He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with <a href="../V3notes/aneye.html">an eye so full of lofty design</a> and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved. They looked at one another, and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire, and consider of what had been said:  that <a href="../V3notes/north.html">I would not lead them further north</a>, if they strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped that, with reflection, <a href="../V3notes/courage2.html">their courage would return</a>.</p><p>

It requires more philosophy than I possess, to bear this <a href="../V3notes/injust.html">injustice</a> with patience.</p> 
<p>September 12th.</p><p> 
    It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; -- I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and, while I am wafted towards England, and towards you, I will not despond.</p>
