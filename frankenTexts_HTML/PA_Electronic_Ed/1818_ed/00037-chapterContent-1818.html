The day of my departure at length arrived.  I had taken leave of all my
friends, excepting Clerval, who spent the last evening with us.  He
bitterly lamented that he was unable to accompany me:  but <a
href="../V1notes/hispap.html">his father</a> could not be persuaded to part
with him, intending that he should become a partner with him in
business, in compliance with his favourite theory, that learning was
superfluous in the commerce of ordinary life.  Henry had a refined mind;
he had no desire to be idle, and was well pleased to become his father's
partner, but he believed that a man might become a very good <a 
href="../V1notes/trader.html">trader</a>, and yet possess a 
cultivated understanding.</p><p>

We sat late, listening to his complaints, and making many little
arrangements for the future.  The next morning early I departed.  Tears
gushed from the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from sorrow at my
departure, and partly because she reflected that the same journey was to
have taken place three months before, when a mother's blessing would have
accompanied me.</p><p>

I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in
the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
pleasure, <a href="../V1notes/iwasnow.html">I was now alone</a>. In the
university, whither I was going, I must form my own friends, and be my own
protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic; and
this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my
brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were "<a
href="../V1notes/oldfam.html">old familiar faces</a>;" but I believed
myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my
reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and
hopes rose. <a href="../V1notes/iardent.html">I ardently desired</a> the
acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to
remain during my youth cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the
world, and take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were
complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.</p>
