<p>

Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the 
<a href="../V1notes/wideocen.html">wide ocean</a>, nor even here
in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to
the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My
lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful <a
href="../V1notes/courage2.html">courage</a> and <a
href="../V1notes/enterpr2.html">enterprise</a>; he is madly desirous of <a
href="../V1notes/glory2.html">glory</a>. He is an Englishman, and in the
midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation,
retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became
acquainted with him on board a whale vessel: finding that he was
unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my
enterprise.</p>
