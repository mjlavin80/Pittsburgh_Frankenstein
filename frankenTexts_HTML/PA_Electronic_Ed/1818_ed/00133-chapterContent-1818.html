"But <a href="../Contexts/pl.html"><i>Paradise Lost</i></a> excited
different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other
volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a <a
href="../V2notes/truehist.html">true history</a>. It moved every feeling
of wonder and awe, that the picture of <a
href="../V2notes/omnipote.html">an omnipotent God warring with his
creatures</a> was capable of exciting. I often referred the several
situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. <a
href="../V2notes/adam.html">Like Adam</a>, I was created apparently united
by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far
different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the
hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the
especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with, and acquire
knowledge from beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless,
and alone. Many times I considered <a
href="../V2notes/satan.html">Satan</a> as the fitter emblem of my
condition; for often, <a href="../V2notes/likehim.html">like him, when I
viewed</a> the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within
me.</p><p>

"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon
after my arrival in the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of
the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected
them; but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they
were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was <a
href="../V2notes/journal.html">your journal</a> of the four months that
preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step
you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with
accounts of domestic occurrences. You, doubtless, recollect these papers.
Here they are. Every thing is related in them which bears reference to my  
accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of
disgusting
circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description
of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your
own horrors, and rendered mine ineffaceable. I sickened as I read. '<a
href="../V2notes/hateful.html">Hateful day when I received life!</a>' I
exclaimed in agony.  'Cursed creator! Why did you form a monster so
hideous that even you turned from me in disgust? God in pity made man
beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but <a
href="../V2notes/myform.html">my form is a filthy type of your's</a>, more
horrid from its very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils,
to admire and encourage him; but I am <a
href="../V2notes/solitary.html">solitary and detested</a>.'</p>
