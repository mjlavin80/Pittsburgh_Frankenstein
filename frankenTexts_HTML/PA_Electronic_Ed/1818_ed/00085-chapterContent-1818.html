When I returned home, Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.</p><p>

"My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; <a
href="../V1notes/alljudge.html">all judges</a> had rather that ten
innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should escape. But she has
confessed."</p><p>

This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon
Justine's innocence. "Alas!" said she, "how shall I ever again believe in
<a href="../V1notes/humanben.html">human benevolence</a>? Justine, whom I
loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of
innocence only to betray; her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity
or ill-humour, and yet she has committed a murder."</p><p>

Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a wish
to see my cousin. <a href="../V1notes/myfather.html">My father wished her 
not to go</a>; but said, that he left it to her own judgment and feelings 
to decide. "Yes," said Elizabeth, "I will go, although she is guilty; and 
you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go alone." The idea of this
visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.</p><p>

We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine
sitting on some straw at the further end; her hands were
manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us
enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at
the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.</p><p>

"Oh, Justine!" said she, "why did you rob me of my last
consolation? I relied on your innocence; and although I was then
very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now."</p>
