Excellent Elizabeth!  A murmur of approbation was heard; but it was
excited by her generous interference, and not in favor of poor Justine, on
whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her
with the <a href="../V1notes/blackest.html">blackest ingratitude</a>. She
herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation
and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her
innocence; I knew it. Could the <a
href="../V1notes/daemon1.html">d√¶mon</a>, who had (I did not for a
minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed
the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my
situation; and when I perceived that the popular voice, and the
countenances of the judges, had already condemned my unhappy victim, I
rushed out of the court in agony. The <a
href="../V1notes/tortures.html">tortures of the accused</a> did not equal
mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the <a
href="../V1notes/fangs.html">fangs of remorse</a> tore my bosom, and would
not forego their hold.</p><p>

I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the
court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal
question; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.
The <a href="../V1notes/ballots.html">ballots</a> had been thrown; they
were all black, and Justine was condemned.</p><p>

I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced
sensations of horror; and <a href="../V1notes/ihaveend.html">I have
endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions</a>, but words cannot
convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The
person to whom I addressed myself added, that Justine had already <a
href="../V1notes/confessd.html">confessed her guilt</a>. "That evidence,"
he observed, "was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of
it; and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon
circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive."</p>
