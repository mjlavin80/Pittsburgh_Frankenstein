"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.
My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a
vice, I confess that it is <a href="../V3notes/devpass.html">the
devouring and only passion of my soul</a>. My rage is
unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned
loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand: I
have but one resource; and I devote myself, either in my life or
death, to his destruction."</p><p>

I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a
phrenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty
fierceness, which <a href="../V3notes/martyrs.html">the martyrs
of old</a> are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those
of devotion and heroism, <a href="../V3notes/elevmad.html">this
elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness</a>. He
endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to
my tale as the effects of delirium.</p><p>

"Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say."</p><p>
I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to
meditate on some other mode of action.</p>
