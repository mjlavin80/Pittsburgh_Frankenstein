Remember, I am not recording the <a href="../V1notes/vision.html">vision
of a madman</a>. The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens,
than that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might have produced it,
yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. After <a
href="../V1notes/days.html">days and nights of incredible labour and
fatigue</a>, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; 
nay, more, I became myself capable of <a
href="../V1notes/bestowig.html">bestowing animation upon lifeless
matter</a>.</p><p>

The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon
gave place to delight and <a href="../V1notes/rapture.html">rapture</a>.
After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the <a
href="../V1notes/summit.html">summit of my desires, was the most
gratifying consummation of my toils</a>. But this discovery was so great
and overwhelming, that all the steps by which I had been progressively led
to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the
study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world, was
now within my grasp. Not that, like a <a
href="../V1notes/likmagic.html">magic scene</a>, it all opened upon me at
once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my
endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search,
than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the <a
href="../V1notes/arabian.html">Arabian</a> who had been buried with the
dead, and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering, and
seemingly ineffectual, light.</p><p>

<a href="../V1notes/iseeby.html">I see by your eagerness</a>, and the
wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be
informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be: listen
patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am
reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and <a
href="../V1notes/ardentas.html">ardent as I then was</a>, to your
destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts,
at least by my example, <a href="../V1notes/howdangr.html">how dangerous
is the acquirement of knowledge</a>, and how much happier that man is who
believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become
greater than his <a href="../V1notes/natwill.html">nature will
allow</a>.</p>
