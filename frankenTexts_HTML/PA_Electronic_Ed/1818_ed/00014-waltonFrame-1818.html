<p>

But do not suppose that, because I complain a little, or because
I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know,
that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as <a
href="../V1notes/fixed.html">fixed as fate</a>; and my voyage is
only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.
The winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises
well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season; so that,
perhaps, I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing
rashly; you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and
considerateness whenever the <a
href="../V1notes/safety.html">safety of others</a> is committed
to my care.</p><p>

I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception
of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful,
with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored
regions, to "<a href="../V1notes/mist.html">the land of mist and
snow</a>;" but I shall kill no albatross, therefore do not be
alarmed for my safety.</p><p>

Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and
returned by <a href="../V1notes/soutcape.html">the most southern
cape</a> of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success,
yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue
to write to me by every opportunity; I may receive your letters
(though the chance is very doubtful) on some occasions when I
need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.
Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me
again.</p><p>

</p><p align="right">Your affectionate brother,</p>
