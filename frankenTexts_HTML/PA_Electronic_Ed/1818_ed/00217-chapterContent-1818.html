<a href="../V3notes/whatfeel.html">What his feelings were</a>
whom I pursued, I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks
in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone, that
guided me, and instigated my fury. "My reign is not yet over,"
(these words were legible in one of these inscriptions); "you
live, and <a href="../V3notes/power.html">my power is
complete</a>. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the
north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which
I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not
too tardily, a dead hare; eat, and be refreshed. <a
href="../V3notes/comeon.html">Come on, my enemy; we have yet to
wrestle for our lives</a>; but many hard and miserable hours must
you endure, until that period shall arrive."</p><p>

Scoffing devil! <a href="../V3notes/againvow.html">Again do I vow
vengeance</a>; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to
torture and death. Never will I omit my search, until he or I
perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth, and
those who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil
and <a href="../V3notes/horpilg.html">horrible pilgrimage</a>.</p><p>

As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows
thickened, and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to
support. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a
few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom
starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey.
The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured;
and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.</p><p>
The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my
labours. One inscription that he left was in these words:
"Prepare! your toils only begin: wrap yourself in furs, and
provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your
sufferings will satisfy my <a
href="../V3notes/everlast.html">everlasting hatred</a>."</p>
