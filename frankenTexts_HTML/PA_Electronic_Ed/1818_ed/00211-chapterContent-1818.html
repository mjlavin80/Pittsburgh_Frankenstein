This address caused <a href="../V3notes/physiog.html">a considerable
change in the physiognomy</a> of my auditor. He had heard my story with <a
href="../V3notes/halfkind.html">that half kind of belief</a> that is given
to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
returned. He, however, answered mildly, "I would willingly afford you
every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to
have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow
an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and dens,
where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed
since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what
place he has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit."</p><p>

"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and
if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like
the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive
your thoughts: <a href="../V3notes/notcred.html">you do not
credit my narrative</a>, and do not intend to pursue my enemy
with the punishment which is his desert."</p><p>

As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was
intimidated; "You are mistaken," said he, "I will exert
myself; if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured
that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But
I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his
properties, that this will prove impracticable, and that, while
every proper measure is pursued, <a
href="../V3notes/disapp.html">you should endeavour to make up
your mind to disappointment</a>."</p>
