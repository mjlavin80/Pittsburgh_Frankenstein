"<a href="../V2notes/youwrong.html">You are in the wrong</a>," replied the
<a href="../V2notes/fiend2.html">fiend</a>; "and, instead of threatening,
I am content to reason with you.  I am malicious because I am miserable; 
am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me
to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man
more than he pities me? You would not call it murder, if you could
precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work
of your own hands. Shall I respect man, when he contemns me? Let him live
with me in the <a href="../V2notes/intercha.html">interchange of
kindness</a>, and, instead of injury, I would bestow every benefit upon
him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the <a
href="../V2notes/senses.html">human senses are insurmountable barriers</a>
to our union. Yet mine shall not be <a href="../V2notes/abject.html">the
submission of abject slavery</a>. I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot
inspire love, <a href="../V2notes/causfear.html">I will cause fear</a>;
and chiefly towards you <a href="../V2notes/archen.html">my arch-enemy,
because my creator</a>, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care: I
will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so
that you curse the hour of your birth."</p><p>

A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was
wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold;
but presently he calmed himself, and proceeded--</p><p>

"I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not 
reflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions 
of <a href="../V2notes/benev2.html">benevolence</a> towards me, I should 
return them an hundred and an hundred fold; for that one creature's sake, 
I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of 
bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and 
moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself: the 
gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall 
content me. It is true, <a href="../V2notes/weshall.html">we shall be 
monsters, cut off from all the world</a>; but on that account we shall be 
more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will 
be harmless, and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! my creator, make me 
happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that 
I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my 
request!"</p>
