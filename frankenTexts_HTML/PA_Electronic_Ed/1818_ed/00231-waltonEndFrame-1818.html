His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve, and be patient. I sat by his bed watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and, bidding me come near, said -- "Alas! the strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel <a href="../V3notes/burning.html">that burning hatred, and ardent desire of revenge</a> I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in <a href="../V3notes/examin.html">examining my past conduct</a>; nor do I find it blameable. In <a href="../V3notes/fit.html">a fit of enthusiastic madness</a> I created a rational creature, and was bound towards him, to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. <a href="../V3notes/duty.html">This was my duty</a>; but there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards my fellow-creatures had <a href="../V3notes/claims.html">greater claims to my attention</a>, because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness, in evil: he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end. <a href="../V3notes/miser.html">Miserable himself, that he may render no other wretched</a>, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When <a href="../V3notes/actuated.html">actuated by selfish and vicious motives</a>, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work;  and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.</p>
