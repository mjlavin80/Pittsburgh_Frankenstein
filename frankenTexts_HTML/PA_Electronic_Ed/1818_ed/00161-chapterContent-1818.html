It was in <a href="../V3notes/august.html">the latter end of
August</a> that I departed, to pass two years of exile. Elizabeth
approved of the reasons of my departure, and <a
href="../V3notes/regret.html">only regretted that she had not the
same opportunities of enlarging her experience, and cultivating
her understanding</a>.  She wept, however, as she bade me
farewell, and entreated me to return happy and tranquil.  "We
all," said she, "depend upon you; and if you are miserable, what
must be our feelings?"</p><p>

I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away,
hardly knowing whither I was going, and <a
href="../V3notes/careless.html">careless of what was passing
around</a>.  I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish
that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments
should be packed to go with me:  for I resolved to fulfil my
promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free man. <a
href="../V3notes/filled.html">Filled with dreary
imaginations</a>, I passed through many beautiful and majestic
scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only
think of the <a href="../V3notes/bourne.html">bourne of my
travels</a>, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they
endured.</p><p>

After some days spent in <a href="../V3notes/listles2.html">listless
indolence</a>, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at
Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great
was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful when
he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it
rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours
of the landscape, and the appearances of the sky. "This is what it is to
live," he cried, "now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein,
wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful?" In truth, I was occupied by
gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the descent of the evening star, nor the
golden sun-rise reflected in the Rhine. -- And <a
href="../V3notes/youmy.html">you, my friend</a>, would be far more amused
with the <a href="../V3notes/journal.html">journal of Clerval</a>, who
observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than to listen
to my reflections. I, a <a href="../V3notes/miswrtch.html">miserable
wretch</a>, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.</p>
