By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved
my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became <a
href="../V1notes/capable.html">capable of observing outward objects</a>
with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had
disappeared, and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees
that shaded my window. <a href="../V1notes/dvnsprng.html">It was a divine
spring</a>; and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt
also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom
disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was
attacked by the fatal passion.</p><p>

"Dearest Clerval," exclaimed I, "how kind, how very good you are to me.
This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised
yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I
feel <a href="../V1notes/remorse.html">the greatest remorse</a> for the
disappointment of which I have been the occasion; but you will forgive
me."</p><p>

"You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose
yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear
in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I
not?"</p><p>

I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to
<a href="../V1notes/object.html">an object</a> on whom I dared not even
think?</p><p>

"Compose yourself," said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, "I
will not mention it, if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would
be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.
They hardly know how ill you have been, and are <a
href="../V1notes/uneasy.html">uneasy at your long silence</a>."</p><p>

"Is that all? my dear Henry. How could you suppose that <a
href="../V1notes/myfirst.html">my first thought would not fly towards
those dear, dear friends</a> whom I love, and who are so deserving of my
love."</p><p> "If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be
glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you: it is
from your cousin, I believe."</p>
