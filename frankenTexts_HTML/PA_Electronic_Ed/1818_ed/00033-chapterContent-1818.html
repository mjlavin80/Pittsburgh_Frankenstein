When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near <a
href="../V1notes/belrive.html">Belrive</a>, when we witnessed a most
violent and <a href="../V1notes/terrible.html">terrible thunder-storm</a>.
It advanced from behind the mountains of <a
href="../Places/jura.html">Jura</a>; and the thunder burst at once with
frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while
the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I
stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old
and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
remained but a <a href="../V1notes/blasted.html">blasted stump</a>. When
we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular
manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin
ribbands of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.</p><p>

The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme astonishment; and I
eagerly inquired of my father the nature and origin of thunder and
lightning.  He replied, "<a
href="../V1notes/electric.html">Electricity</a>;" describing at the same
time the various effects of that power.  He constructed a small electrical
machine, and exhibited a few experiments; he made also a <a
href="../V1notes/kite.html">kite</a>, with a wire and string, which drew
down that fluid from the clouds.</p><p>

This last stroke completed the overthrow of <a
href="../People/agrippa.html">Cornelius Agrippa</a>, <a
href="../People/albertus.html">Albertus Magnus</a>, and <a
href="../People/paracels.html">Paracelsus</a>, who had so long reigned the
lords of my imagination.  But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to
commence the study of any modern system; and this disinclination was
influenced by the following circumstance.</p>
