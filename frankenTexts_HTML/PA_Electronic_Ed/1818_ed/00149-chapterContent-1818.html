"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering
on his breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely
woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a
few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by
deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned:
I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that
such beautiful creatures could bestow; and that she whose
resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed
that air of divine benignity to one expressive of <a 
href="../V2notes/affright.html">disgust and affright</a>.</p><p>

"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?
I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my
sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among
mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.</p><p>

"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot
where I had committed the murder, and was seeking a more secluded
hiding-place, when I perceived a woman passing near me.  She was
young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but
of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in the loveliness of youth
and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose smiles are
bestowed on all but me; she shall not escape:  thanks to <a 
href="../V2notes/lessons.html">the
lessons of Felix, and the sanguinary laws of man</a>, I have learned
how to work mischief.  I approached her unperceived, and placed
the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.</p><p>

"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place;
sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its
miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have
ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a <a
href="../V2notes/burning.html">burning passion</a> which you alone can
gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply with my
requisition. <a href="../V2notes/alone.html">I am alone, and
miserable</a>;  man will not associate with me; but one as <a
href="../V2notes/deformed.html">deformed and horrible as myself would not
deny herself to me</a>. My companion must be of the same species, and have
the same defects. This being <a href="../V2notes/create.html">you must
create</a>."</p>
