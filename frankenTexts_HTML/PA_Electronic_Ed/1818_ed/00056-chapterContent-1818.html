"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
occupation, that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see:
but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
end, and that <a href="../V1notes/iamfree.html">I am at length
free</a>."</p><p>

I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick
pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought
made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might
still be there, <a href="../V1notes/alive.html">alive</a>, and walking 
about. I dreaded to behold <a
href="../V1notes/monster.html">this monster</a>; but I feared still more
that Henry should see him. Entreating him therefore to remain a few
minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My
hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I
then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly
open, as children are accustomed to do when <a
href="../V1notes/spectre.html">they expect a spectre</a> to stand in
waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped
fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bed-room was also freed from
its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good-fortune
could have befallen me; but when I became assured that <a
href="../V1notes/myenemy.html">my enemy</a> had indeed fled, I clapped my
hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.</p><p>

We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but
I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; <a
href="../V1notes/ifelt.html">I felt my flesh tingle with excess of
sensitiveness</a>, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a
single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my
hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits
to joy on his arrival; but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a
<a href="../V1notes/wildness.html">wildness</a> in my eyes for which he
could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, <a
href="../V1notes/heartles.html">heartless laughter</a>, frightened and
astonished him.</p>
