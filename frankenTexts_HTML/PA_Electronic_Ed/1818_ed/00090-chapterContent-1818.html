<h2 >VOLUME II. CHAPTER I.</h2> 
N<small>OTHING</small> is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like <a href="../V2notes/evilspir.html">an evil spirit</a>, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more, <a href="../V2notes/ipersuad.html">(I persuaded myself)</a> was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and the love of virtue. I had begun life with <a href="../V2notes/beneintn.html">benevolent intentions</a>, and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice, and <a href="../V2notes/makemysf.html">make myself useful</a> to my fellow-beings. Now <a href="../V2notes/alblast.html">all was blasted</a>: instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the <a href="../V2notes/sensgult.html">sense of guilt</a>, which hurried me away to a <a href="../V2notes/ahell.html">hell of intense tortures</a>, such as <a href="../V2notes/nolang.html">no language can describe</a>.</p><p> 
This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation -- <a href="../V2notes/deepdark.html">deep, dark, death-like solitude</a>.</p><p> 
My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits, and endeavoured to reason with me on the folly of giving way to immoderate grief.  "Do you think, Victor," said he, "that I do not suffer also? <a href="../V2notes/noonelov.html">No one could love a child more</a> than I loved your brother;" (tears came into his eyes as he spoke); "but is it not a duty to the survivors, that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also <a href="../V2notes/aduty.html">a duty</a> owed to yourself; for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of <a href="../V2notes/dayuse.html">daily usefulness</a>, without which no man is fit for society."</p><p> 
This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief, and console my friends, if remorse had not mingled its bitterness with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself from his view.</p>
