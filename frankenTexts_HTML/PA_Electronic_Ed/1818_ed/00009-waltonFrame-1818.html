This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly
quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my
opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stage-coach. The cold
is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs, a dress which I have already
adopted; for there is a great difference between walking the deck and
remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood
from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life
on <a href="../V1notes/postroad.html">the post-road</a> between <a
href="../Places/stpeters.html">St. Petersburgh</a> and <a
href="../V1notes/archangl.html">Archangel</a>.</p><p>

I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks;
and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be
done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many
sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to
the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of <a
href="../V1notes/june.html">June</a>: and when shall I return?
Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed,
many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may
meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.</p><p>

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down
blessings on you, and save me, that I may <a
href="../V1notes/again.html">again and again testify</a> my
gratitude for all your love and kindness.
