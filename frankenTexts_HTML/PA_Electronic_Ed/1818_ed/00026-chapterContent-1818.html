Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten
months before my father discovered his abode.  Overjoyed at this
discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street,
near the <a href="../V1notes/reuss.html">Reuss</a>. But when he entered,
misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small
sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to
provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped
to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval
was consequently <a href="../V1notes/inaction.html">spent in inaction</a>;
his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for
reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the
end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any
exertion.</p><p>

His daughter <a href="../V1notes/attend.html">attended</a> him with the
greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that their little fund was
rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of support. But
Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage
rose to support her in her adversity. She procured <a
href="../V1notes/plain.html">plain work</a>; she <a
href="../V1notes/plaited.html">plaited straw</a>; and by various means
contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p><p>

Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was
more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her
an <a href="../V1notes/orphan.html">orphan</a> and a beggar. This last
blow overcame her; and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin, weeping bitterly,
when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to
the poor girl, who committed herself to his care, and after the interment
of his friend he conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the
protection of a relation. <a href="../V1notes/twoyears.html">Two years
after</a> this event Caroline became his wife.</p>
