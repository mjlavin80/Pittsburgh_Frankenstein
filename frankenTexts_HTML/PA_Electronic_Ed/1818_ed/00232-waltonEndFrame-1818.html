"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends, to fulfill this task; and now, that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and <a href="../V3notes/duties.html">the well  balancing of what you may esteem your duties</a>, I leave to you; my  judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I  dare not ask you to do what I think right, for <a  href="../V3notes/passion.html">I may still be misled by passion</a>.</p><p>

Seek happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, <a  href="../V3notes/succeed.html">yet another may succeed</a>."</p><p>

Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of <a href="../V3notes/spirit.html">this glorious spirit</a>? What can I say  that will enable  you to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; <a  href="../V3notes/cloud.html">my  mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment</a>. But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.</p>
