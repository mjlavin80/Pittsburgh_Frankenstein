My father expressed a wish that I should attend a course of lectures upon
natural philosophy, to which <a href="../V1notes/cheerful.html">I
cheerfully consented</a>. Some accident prevented my attending these
lectures until the course was nearly finished.  The lecture, being
therefore one of the last, was entirely <a
href="../V1notes/incompreh.html">incomprehensible to me</a>. The professor
discoursed with the greatest fluency of potassium and boron, of sulphates
and oxyds, terms to which I could affix no idea; and I became disgusted
with the science of natural philosophy, although I still read <a
href="../People/pliny.html">Pliny</a> and <a
href="../Buffon/buffon.html">Buffon</a> with delight, authors, in my
estimation, of nearly equal interest and <a
href="../V1notes/equal.html">utility</a>.</p><p>

My occupations at this age were principally the <a
href="../V1notes/math.html">mathematics</a>, and most of the branches of
study appertaining to that science. I was busily employed in learning
languages; Latin was already familiar to me, and I began to read some of
the easiest Greek authors without the help of a <a
href="../V1notes/latin1.html">lexicon</a>. I also perfectly understood
English and German.  This is the list of my accomplishments at the age of
seventeen; and you may conceive that my hours were fully employed in
acquiring and maintaining a knowledge of this various literature.</p><p>

Another task also devolved upon me, when I became the instructor of my
brothers.  <a href="../V1notes/ernest.html">Ernest</a> was six years
younger than myself, and was my principal pupil.  He had been afflicted
with ill health from his infancy, through which Elizabeth and I had been
his constant nurses:  his disposition was gentle, but he was incapable of
any severe application.  <a href="../V1notes/william.html">William</a>,
the youngest of our family, was yet an infant, and the most beautiful
little fellow in the world; his lively blue eyes, dimpled cheeks, and
endearing manners, inspired the tenderest affection.</p><p>

Such was <a href="../V1notes/domest1.html">our domestic circle</a>, from
which care and pain seemed for ever banished.  My father directed our
studies, and my mother partook of our enjoyments.  Neither of us
possessed <a href="../V1notes/neither.html">the slightest pre-eminence
over the other</a>; <a href="../V1notes/voice.html">the voice of
command</a> was never heard amongst us; but mutual affection engaged us
all to comply with and obey the slightest desire of each other.</p>
