What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people; and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present <a href="../V2notes/resolved.html">I would remain quietly in my hovel</a>, watching, and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.</p><p>
