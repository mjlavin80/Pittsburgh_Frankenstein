We arrived at Havre on the <a href="../V3notes/may8.html">8th of
May</a>, and instantly proceeded to Paris, where my father had
some business which detained us a few weeks.  In this city, I
received the following letter from Elizabeth:--</p><p>

"<i>To</i> V<small>ICTOR</small>
    F<small>RANKENSTEIN</small>.</p><p>

"<small>MY DEAREST FRIEND</small>,</p><p>

"It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my
uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance,
and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor
cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see you
looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter
has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by
anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance,
and to find that your heart is not totally devoid of comfort and
tranquillity.</p><p>

"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so
miserable <a href="../V3notes/yearago.html">a year ago</a>, even
perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at this period
when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation that
I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some
explanation necessary before we meet.</p><p>

"Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to
explain? If you really say this, my questions are answered, and I
have no more to do than to sign myself your affectionate cousin.
But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may <a
href="../V3notes/dread.html">dread, and yet be pleased</a> with
this explanation; and, in a probability of this being the case, I
dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I
have often wished to express to you, but have never had the
courage to begin.</p>
