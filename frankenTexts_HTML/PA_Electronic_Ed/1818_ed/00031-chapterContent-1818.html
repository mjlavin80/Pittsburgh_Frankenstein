If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to
me, that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a
modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much greater
powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were <a
href="../V1notes/chimeric.html">chimerical</a>, while those of the former
were real and practical; under such circumstances, I should certainly have
thrown Agrippa aside, and, with my imagination warmed as it was, should
probably have applied myself to the more <a
href="../V1notes/chemisty.html">rational theory of chemistry</a> which has
resulted from modern discoveries.  It is even possible, that the train of
my ideas would never have received the <a
href="../V1notes/fatal.html">fatal impulse</a> that led to my ruin. But
the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me
that he was acquainted with its contents; and I continued to read with the
greatest avidity.</p><p>

When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this
author, and afterwards of <a
href="../People/paracels.html">Paracelsus</a> and <a
href="../People/albertus.html">Albertus Magnus</a>. I read and studied
the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
treasures known to few beside myself; and although I have often wished to
communicate these <a href="../V1notes/secret.html">secret stores of
knowledge</a> to my father, yet his indefinite censure of my favourite
Agrippa always withheld me.  I disclosed my discoveries to Elizabeth,
therefore, under a promise of strict secrecy; but she did not interest
herself in the subject, and I was left by her <a
href="../V1notes/topursue.html">to pursue my studies alone</a>.</p>
