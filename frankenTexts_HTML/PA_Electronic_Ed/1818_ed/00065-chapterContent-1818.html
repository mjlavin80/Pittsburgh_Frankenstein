M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of 
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me 
even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. "D--n the 
fellow!" cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us 
all. Aye, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster 
who, but a few years ago, believed <a
href="../People/agrippa.html">Cornelius Agrippa</a> as firmly as the
gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is
not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance. -- Aye, aye,"
continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, "M. Frankenstein
is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be
diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval; I was myself when young;
but that wears out in a very short time."</p><p>

M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which
happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so
annoying to me.</p><p>

Clerval was no natural philosopher.  His imagination was too vivid for the
minutiae of science.  <a href="../V1notes/langwere.html">Languages were
his principal study</a>; and he sought, but acquiring their elements, to
open a field for self-instruction on his return to Geneva.  Persian,
Arabic, and Hebrew, gained his attention, after he had made himself
perfectly master of Greek and Latin.  For my own part, idleness had ever
been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and
hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil
with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the
works of the orientalists. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
elevating to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any
other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a
warm <a href="../V1notes/sunand.html">sun and garden</a> of roses, in
<a href="../V1notes/fairenem.html">the smiles and frowns of a fair 
enemy</a>, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from 
the <a href="../V1notes/manpoem.html">manly
and heroical poetry</a> of Greece and Rome.</p>
