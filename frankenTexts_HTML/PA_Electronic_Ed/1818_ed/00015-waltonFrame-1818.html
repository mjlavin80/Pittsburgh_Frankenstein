<h2 >LETTER III.</h2> 
<center><i>To Mrs. S<small>AVILLE</small>, England.</i></center> 
<p >July 7th, 17--.</p><p> 
<small>MY DEAR SISTER</small>,</p><p> 
I <small>WRITE</small> a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and <a href="../V1notes/advanced.html">well advanced on my voyage</a>. This letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: <a href="../V1notes/bold.html">my men are bold, and apparently firm of purpose</a>; nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards <a href="../V1notes/ardent2.html">those shores which I so ardently desire to attain</a>, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.</p><p> 
No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two stiff gales, and <a href="../V1notes/mast.html">the breaking of a mast</a>, are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content, if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.</p><p> 
Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as your's, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.</p><p> 
Remember me to all my English friends.</p> 
<p>Most affectionately yours,</p> 
<p >R.W.</p>
