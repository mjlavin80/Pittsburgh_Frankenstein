I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
journey to Ingolstadt, which was <a href="../V1notes/longand.html">long
and fatiguing</a>. At length the <a href="../V1notes/highwhit.html">high
white steeple</a> of the town met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted
to my solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased.</p><p>

The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit
to some of the principal <a href="../Gifs/univ.html">professors</a>, and
among others to <a href="../V1notes/krempe.html">M. Krempe</a>, <a
href="../V1notes/professr.html">professor of natural philosophy</a>. He
received me with politeness, and asked me several questions concerning my
progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural
philosophy.  I mentioned, it is true, with fear and trembling, the only
authors I had ever read upon those subjects.  The professor stared: "Have
you," he said, "really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"</p><p>

I replied in the affirmative. "Every minute," continued M. Krempe with
warmth, "every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and
entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems, and
useless names. Good God! in what desert land have you lived, where no one
was kind enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have so
greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are
ancient? I little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find
a disciple of <a href="../People/albertus.html">Albertus Magnus</a> and
<a href="../People/paracels.html">Paracelsus</a>. My dear Sir, you must
begin your studies entirely anew."</p><p>

So saying, he stepped aside, and wrote down a list of several books
treating of natural philosophy, which he desired me to procure, and
dismissed me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week
he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in
its general relations, and that <a href="../V1notes/waldman.html">M.
Waldman</a>, a fellow-professor, would lecture upon chemistry the
alternate days that he missed.</p>
