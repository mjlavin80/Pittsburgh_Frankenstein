<h2 >CHAPTER VI.</h2> 
    <p>O<small>N</small> my return, I found the following letter from my father:--</p> 
    <p><center><i>"To</i> V. F<small>RANKENSTEIN</small>.</center></p><p> 
"<small>MY DEAR VICTOR</small>,</p><p> 
"You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and gay welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on an absent <a href="../V1notes/absent.html">child?</a> I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page, to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.</p><p> 
<a href="../V1notes/william.html">"William is dead!</a> -- that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!</p><p> 
"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.</p>
