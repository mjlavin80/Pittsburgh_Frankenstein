Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of
unbounded wonder, "My dearest Victor, what infatuation is
this? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion
again."</p><p>

"<a href="../V3notes/notmad.html">I am not mad</a>," I cried
energetically; "the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my
operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of
those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A
thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to
have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed <a
href="../V3notes/sacrific.html">I could not sacrifice the whole
human race</a>."</p><p>

The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my
ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our
conversation, and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He
wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes
that had taken place in Ireland, and never alluded to them, or
suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.</p><p>

As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling
in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner
of my own crimes; <a href="../V3notes/suffic.html">sufficient for
me was the consciousness of them</a>. By the utmost
self-violence, <a href="../V3notes/icurbed.html">I curbed the
imperious voice of wretchedness</a>, which sometimes desired to
declare itself to the whole world; and my manners were calmer and
more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea
of ice.</p>
