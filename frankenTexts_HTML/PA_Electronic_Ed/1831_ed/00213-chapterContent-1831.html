As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from
cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.
But <a href="../V3notes/conceal.html">I concealed my feelings by
an appearance of hilarity</a>, that brought smiles and joy to the
countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful
and <a href="../V3notes/nicer.html">nicer eye</a> of Elizabeth.
She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not
unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had
impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness,
might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace but
deep and everlasting regret.</p><p>

Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were received;
and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my
own heart the anxiety that preyed there, and entered with seeming
earnestness into the <a href="../V3notes/plans.html">plans of my
father</a>, although they might only serve as the decorations of my
tragedy.  Through my father's exertions, <a
href="../V3notes/inherit.html">a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth</a>
had been restored to her by the Austrian government. A small possession on
the shores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed that, immediately after
our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza, and spend our first days of
happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.</p><p>

In the mean time I took every precaution to defend my person,
in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and
a dagger constantly about me, and was ever on the watch to
prevent artifice; and by these means gained a greater degree of
tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, <a
href="../V3notes/delusion.html">the threat
appeared more as a delusion</a>, not to be regarded as worthy to
disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage
wore a greater appearance of certainty, as the day fixed for its
solemnisation drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken of as
an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.</p>
