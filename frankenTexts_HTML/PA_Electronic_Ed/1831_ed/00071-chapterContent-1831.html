<h2 >CHAPTER VI</h2> 
C<small>LERVAL</small> then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own Elizabeth:--</p><p> 
"My dearest Cousin,</p><p> 
"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to write -- to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey; yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sick bed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes, nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will <a href="../V1notes/youwill.html">confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting</a>.</p><p> 
"Get well -- and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home, and friends who love you dearly. <a href="../V1notes/papheal.html">Your father's health</a> is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, -- but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our <a href="../V1notes/ernest.html">Ernest</a>! He is now sixteen, and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss, and to enter into foreign service; but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother return to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country;  but Ernest never had your powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; -- his time is spent in the open air, climbing hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler, unless we yield the point, and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.</p>
