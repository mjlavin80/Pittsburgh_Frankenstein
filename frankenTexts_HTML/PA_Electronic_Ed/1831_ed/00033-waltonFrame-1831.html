My affection for my <a href="../V1notes/guest.html">guest</a> increases
every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing
degree. How can I see <a href="../V1notes/sonoble.html">so noble a
creature</a> destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?
He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he
speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow
with rapidity and <a href="../V1notes/unparal.html">unparalleled
eloquence</a>.</p><p>

He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck,
apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although
unhappy, he is <a href="../V1notes/notso.html">not so utterly occupied</a>
by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of
others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have
communicated to him <a href="../V1notes/wodisgui.html">without
disguise</a>. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my
eventual success, and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken
to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced, to use
the language of my heart; to give utterance to <a
href="../V1notes/burnard.html">the burning ardour of my soul</a>; and to
say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my
fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise.
One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the <a
href="../V1notes/acquire.html">acquirement of the knowledge</a> which I
sought; for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental
foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's
countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion;
he placed his hands before his eyes; and my voice quivered and failed me,
as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers, -- a groan burst
from his heaving breast. I paused; -- at length he spoke, in broken
accents: -- "Unhappy man! Do you <a href="../V1notes/sharemy.html">share
my madness</a>? Have you drank also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,
-- let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!"</p><p>

Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the 
paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened 
powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary 
to restore his composure.</p><p>

Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise 
himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the <a 
href="../V1notes/darktyr.html">dark tyranny of 
despair</a>, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He 
asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told: but 
it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding 
<a href="../V1notes/afriend.html">a friend</a> -- of my thirst for a more 
intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and 
expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness, who 
did not enjoy this blessing.</p>
