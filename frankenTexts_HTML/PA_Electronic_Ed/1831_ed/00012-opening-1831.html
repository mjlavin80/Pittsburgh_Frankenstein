I opened mine in terror.  The idea so possessed my mind, that a
thrill of fear ran through me, and I wished to exchange the
ghastly image of my fancy for the realities around.  <a
href="../V1notes/iseethem.html">I see them
still</a>; the very room, the dark <i>parquet</i>, the closed
shutters, with the moonlight struggling through, and the sense I
had that the glassy lake and white high Alps were beyond.  I
could not so easily get rid of my hideous phantom; still it
haunted me.  I must try to think of something else.  I recurred
to my ghost story, my tiresome unlucky ghost story!  O! if I
could only contrive one which would frighten my reader as I
myself had been frightened that night!</p><p>

Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon
me.  "I have found it!  What terrified me will terrify others;
and I need only describe the spectre which had haunted my
midnight pillow."  On the morrow I announced that I had
<i>thought of a story</i>.  I began that day with the words,
<a href="../V1notes/itwasona.html"><i>It was on a dreary night of
November</i></a>, making only a
transcript of the grim terrors of my waking dream.</p>
