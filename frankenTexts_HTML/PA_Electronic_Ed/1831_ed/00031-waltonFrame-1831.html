When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the
men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him
to be tormented by <a href="../V1notes/theridle.html">their idle
curiosity</a>, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently
depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he
had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?</p><p>

His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest
gloom; and he replied, "To seek one who fled from me."</p><p>

"And did the <a href="../V1notes/man.html">man</a> whom you pursued travel in the same
fashion?"</p><p>

"Yes."</p><p>

"Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked
you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it,
across the ice."</p><p>

This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a
multitude of questions concerning the route which the <a
href="../V1notes/daemon.html">d√¶mon</a>, as
he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with
me, he said, -- "I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as
well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to
make inquiries."</p><p>

"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman
in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine."</p><p>

"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous
situation; you have <a href="../V1notes/benevol.html">benevolently</a> restored me to
life."</p>
