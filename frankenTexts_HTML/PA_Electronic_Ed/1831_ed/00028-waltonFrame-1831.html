<center><i>To Mrs. S<small>AVILLE</small>, England.</i></center> 
<p >August 5th, 17--.</p><p> 
So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.</p><p> 
Last <a href="../V1notes/monday.html">Monday (July 31st)</a>, we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the <a href="../V1notes/searoom.html">sea-room</a> in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.</p><p> 
About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow <a href="../V1notes/anxious.html">watchful with anxious thoughts</a>, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention, and <a href="../V1notes/diverted.html">diverted our solicitude from our own situation</a>. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: <a href="../V1notes/being.html">a being which had the shape of a man</a>, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until <a href="../V1notes/lost.html">he was lost</a> among the distant inequalities of the ice.</p>
