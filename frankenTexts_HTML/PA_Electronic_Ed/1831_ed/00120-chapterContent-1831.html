"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive; but, on the
appearance of his companions, he assumed a more cheerful air, and
they sat down to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young
woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage; the old man
walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning
on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the
contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was old, with
silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love;
the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his
features were moulded with the finest symmetry; yet his eyes and
attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old
man returned to the cottage; and the youth, with tools different
from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across
the fields.</p><p>

"Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the
cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of <a
href="../V2notes/tapers.html">tapers</a>, and was delighted to find that
the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in
watching my human neighbours. In the evening, the young girl and her
companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand;
and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine
sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished,
the youth began, not to play, but <a href="../V2notes/toutter.html">to
utter sounds</a> that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony
of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds: I since found that
he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or
letters.</p><p>

"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short
time, extinguished their lights, and retired, as I conjectured,
to rest.</p>
