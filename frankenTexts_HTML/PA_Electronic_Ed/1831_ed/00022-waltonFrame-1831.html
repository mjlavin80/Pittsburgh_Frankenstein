<p >Archangel, 28th March, 17--.</p> 
How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a <a href="../V1notes/vessel.html">vessel</a>, and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged, appear to be <a href="../V1notes/men.html">men on whom I can depend</a>, and are certainly possessed of <a href="../V1notes/daunt.html">dauntless courage.</a>
