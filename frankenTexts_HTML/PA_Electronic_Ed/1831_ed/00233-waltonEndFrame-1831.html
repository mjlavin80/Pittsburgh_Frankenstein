Y<small>OU</small> have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congealed with horror, like that which even now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he <a href="../V3notes/command.html">commanded his countenance</a> and tones, and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.</p><p> 
His tale is connected, and told with an <a href="../V3notes/appear.html">appearance of the simplest truth</a>; yet I own to you that <a href="../V3notes/letters.html">the letters of Felix and Safie</a>, which he showed me, and the <a href="../V3notes/monster2.html">apparition of the monster</a> seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has then really existence! I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's formation; but on this point he was impenetrable.</p><p> 
"<a href="../V3notes/mad2.html">Are you mad</a>, my friend?" said he; "or whither does your <a href="../V3notes/curios.html">senseless curiosity</a> lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a <a href="../V3notes/enemy.html">demoniacal enemy</a>? Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do not seek to increase your own."</p>
