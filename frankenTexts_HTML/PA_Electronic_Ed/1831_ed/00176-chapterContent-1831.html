Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved <a
href="../V3notes/post.html">to post</a> the remainder of our way; for <a
href="../V3notes/windstre.html">the wind was contrary, and the stream of
the river was too gentle</a> to aid us.</p><p>

Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful
scenery; but we arrived in a few days at <a
href="../V3notes/rotterdm.html">Rotterdam</a>, whence we
proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning, in the <a
href="../V3notes/septemb.html">latter days of</a> December, that
I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames
presented a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost
every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw <a
href="../V3notes/tilbury.html">Tilbury Fort</a>, and remembered
the Spanish armada; <a
href="../Places/gravesen.html">Gravesend</a>, <a
href="../Places/woolwich.html">Woolwich</a>, and <a
href="../Places/greenwch.html">Greenwich</a>, places which I had
heard of even in my country.</p><p>

At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's
towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.</p>
