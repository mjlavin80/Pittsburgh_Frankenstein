"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and
drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, <a 
href="../V2notes/hiseyes.html">he placed his hands before his eyes</a>, 
and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face, and 
said, 'Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; 
listen to me.'</p><p>

"He struggled violently. 'Let me go,' he cried; '<a
href="../V2notes/monster2.html">monster</a>! ugly wretch! you wish to eat
me, and tear me to pieces -- <a href="../V2notes/ogre.html">You are an
ogre</a> -- Let me go, or I will tell my papa.'</p><p>

"'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come
with me.'</p><p>

"'<a href="../V2notes/hideous.html">Hideous monster!</a> let me go; <a
href="../V2notes/syndic.html">My papa is a Syndic</a> -- he is M. 
Frankenstein -- he will punish you. You dare not keep me.'</p><p>

"'Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy -- to him towards
whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.'</p><p>

"The child still struggled, and <a href="../V2notes/epithets.html">loaded
me with epithets</a> which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his
throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.</p><p>

"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and <a
href="../V2notes/hellish.html">hellish triumph</a>: clapping my hands, I
exclaimed, 'I, too, can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable;
this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall
torment and destroy him.'</p>
