I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
journey to Ingolstadt, which was <a href="../V1notes/longand.html">long
and fatiguing</a>. At length the <a href="../V1notes/highwhit.html">high
white steeple</a> of the town met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted
to my solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased.</p><p>

The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit
to some of the principal <a href="../Gifs/univ.html">professors</a>. 
Chance -- or rather the evil influence, <a 
href="../V1notes/angelofd.html">the Angel of Destruction</a>,
which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my  
reluctant steps from my father's door -- led me first to <a
href="../V1notes/krempe.html">M. Krempe</a>,  <a
href="../V1notes/professr.html">professor of natural philosophy</a>. He was 
an uncouth man, but deeply   embued in the secrets of his science. He
asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different
branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied
carelessly; and, partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchymists as 
the principal authors I had studied.  The professor stared: "Have
you," he said, "really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"</p><p>

I replied in the affirmative. "Every minute," continued M. Krempe with
warmth, "every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and
entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and
useless names. Good God! in what desert land have you lived, where no one
was kind enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have so
greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are
ancient? I little expected in this enlightened and scientific age, to find
a disciple of <a href="../People/albertus.html">Albertus Magnus</a> and
<a href="../People/paracels.html">Paracelsus</a>. My dear sir, you must
begin your studies entirely anew."</p><p>

So saying, he stepped aside, and wrote down a list of several books
treating of natural philosophy, which he desired me to procure; and
dismissed me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week
he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in
its general relations, and that <a href="../V1notes/waldman.html">M.
Waldman</a>, a fellow-professor, would lecture upon chemistry the
alternate days that he omitted.</p>
