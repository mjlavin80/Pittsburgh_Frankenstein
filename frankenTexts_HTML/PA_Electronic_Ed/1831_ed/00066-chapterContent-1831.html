I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily
exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the
streets, without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was doing.
My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on with
irregular steps, not daring to look about me:--</p>

<blockquote>

Like one who, on a lonely road,<br/>
   Doth walk in fear and dread,<br/>
And, having once turned round, walks on,<br/>
   And turns no more his head;<br/>
Because he knows a frightful fiend<br/>
   Doth close behind him tread.<sup>*</sup>

</blockquote>

<p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;
but I remained some minutes with <a href="../V1notes/eyefixed.html">my
eyes fixed on a coach</a> that was coming towards me from the other end of
the street. As it drew nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss <a
href="../V1notes/diligenc.html">diligence</a>: it stopped just where I was
standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived <a
href="../V1notes/henry.html">Henry Clerval</a>, who, on seeing me,
instantly sprung out. "My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed he, "how glad I am
to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my
alighting!"</p><p>
