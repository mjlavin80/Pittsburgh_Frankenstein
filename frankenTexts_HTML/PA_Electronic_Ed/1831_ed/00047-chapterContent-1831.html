<h2 >CHAPTER III</h2> 
W<small>HEN</small> I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I should become a student at the <a href="../V1notes/univers.html">university</a> of <a href="../Places/ingolst.html">Ingolstadt</a>. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion of my <a href="../V1notes/educat1.html">education</a>, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred -- <a href="../V1notes/anomen.html">an omen</a>, as it were, of my future misery.</p><p> 
Elizabeth had caught the <a href="../V1notes/scarlet.html">scarlet fever</a>; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.  During her illness, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sick bed, -- her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper, -- Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her <a href="../V1notes/deathbed.html">death-bed</a> the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: -- "My children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world."</p>
