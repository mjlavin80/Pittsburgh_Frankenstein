<p>

Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of <a 
href="../Places/chamouni.html">Chamounix</a>; I took no rest,  
but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give  
no expression to my sensations -- they weighed on me with a  
mountain's weight, and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.  
Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the  
family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm; but I  
answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were  
placed under a ban -- as if <a href="../V2notes/noright.html">I had no 
right to claim their sympathies</a> -- as if never more might I enjoy 
companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to 
save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The 
prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence 
pass before me like a dream; and that thought only had to me the reality 
of life.</p>
