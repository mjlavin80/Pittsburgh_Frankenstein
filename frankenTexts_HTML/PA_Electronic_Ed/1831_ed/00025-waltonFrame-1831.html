The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is
remarkable in the ship for his <a
href="../V1notes/gentlens.html">gentleness</a> and the mildness
of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his well known
integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage
him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under <a
href="../V1notes/yourgent.html">your gentle and feminine
fosterage</a>, has so refined the groundwork of my character,
that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to <a
href="../V1notes/brutal.html">the usual brutality</a> exercised
on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary; and when
I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart,
and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt
myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.
I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who
owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his
story.  Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate
fortune; and having amassed a considerable sum in <a
href="../V1notes/prizmony.html">prize-money</a>, the father of
the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before
the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing
herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at
the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and
that her father would never consent to the union. My generous
friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name
of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit.  He had already
bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass
the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his
rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase
stock, and then himself solicited the young woman's father to
consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly
refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend; who, when
he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
until he heard that his former mistress was married according to
her inclinations. <a href="../V1notes/noble.html">"What a noble
fellow!"</a> you will exclaim.  He is so; but then he is wholly
uneducated: he is as <a href="../V1notes/silent.html">silent as a
Turk</a>, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which,
while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from
the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.</p>
