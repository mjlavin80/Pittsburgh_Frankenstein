"I agree with you," replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures,
<a href="../V1notes/halfmade.html">but half made up</a>, if one wiser, 
better, dearer than ourselves -- such a friend ought to be -- do not lend 
his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. <a 
href="../V1notes/ionce.html">I once had a friend</a>, the most noble of 
human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting 
friendship.  You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause 
for despair. But I -- I have lost every thing, and <a
href="../V1notes/cannot.html">cannot begin life anew</a>."</p><p>

As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm
settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent,
and presently retired to his cabin.</p><p>

Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does
the <a href="../V1notes/beauties.html">beauties of nature</a>. The starry
sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems
still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a
double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by
disappointments; yet, when he has <a href="../V1notes/hehas.html">retired
into himself</a>, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo
around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p><p>

Will you smile at the <a href="../V1notes/enthusi.html">enthusiasm</a> I
express concerning this <a href="../V1notes/divine.html">divine
wanderer</a>? You would not, if you saw him. You have been tutored and
refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are, therefore,
<a href="../V1notes/fastidio.html">somewhat fastidious</a>; but this only 
renders you the more fit to appreciate the <a 
href="../V1notes/merits.html">extraordinary merits</a> of this wonderful 
man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he 
possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I 
ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment; a quick but 
neverfailing power of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things, 
unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of 
expression, and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.</p>
