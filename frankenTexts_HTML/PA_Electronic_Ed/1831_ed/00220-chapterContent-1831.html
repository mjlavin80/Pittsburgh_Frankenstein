I arrived at Geneva. My father and <a
href="../V3notes/ernlive.html">Ernest yet lived</a>; but the former sunk
under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old
man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
delight -- his Elizabeth, <a href="../V3notes/morethan.html">his more than daughter</a>, whom he doated on with all that affection which a man feels,
who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly
to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on
his grey hairs, and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live
under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of
existence suddenly gave way: he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a
few days he died in my arms.</p><p>

What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and
chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.
Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows
and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; but I awoke, and
found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I
gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation, and was
then released from my prison. For <a
href="../V3notes/callmad.html">they had called me mad</a>; and
during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my
habitation.</p><p>

<a href="../V3notes/liberty.html">Liberty, however, had been an useless
gift</a> to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time
awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I
began to reflect on their cause -- <a href="../V3notes/monsdaem.html">the
monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon</a> whom I had sent
abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by <a
href="../V3notes/madrage.html">a maddening rage</a> when I thought of him,
and desired and <a href="../V3notes/ardpray.html">ardently prayed</a> that
I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on
his cursed head.</p>
