"When younger," said he, "I believed myself <a href="../V3notes/destined.html">destined</a> for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me, when others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with <a href="../V3notes/projector.html">the herd of common projectors</a>.  But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as nothing; and, <a href="../V3notes/archangl.html">like the archangel</a> who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My <a href="../V3notes/imaginat.html">imagination</a> was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation.  Despondency rarely visited my heart; <a href="../V3notes/highdest.html">a high destiny seemed to bear me on</a>, until I fell, never, never again to rise."</p><p> 
Must I then lose this admirable being? <a href="../V3notes/friend.html">I have longed for a friend</a>; I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one; but, I fear, I have gained him only to know his value, and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.</p>
