We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld
her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her
childish years. There was <a href="../V1notes/franknes.html">the same
candour</a>, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more
full of sensibility and intellect.  She welcomed me with the greatest
affection. "Your arrival, my dear cousin," said she, "fills me with hope.
You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.
Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence
as certainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we
have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I
sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is
condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she
will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my
little William."</p><p>

"She is innocent, my Elizabeth," said I, "and that shall be
proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the
assurance of her acquittal."</p><p>

"How kind and generous you are! <a href="../V1notes/herguilt.html">every
one else believes in her guilt</a>, and that made me wretched; for I knew
that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly
a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing." She wept.</p><p>

"Dearest niece," said my father, "dry your tears. If she is, as you
believe, innocent, rely on the <a href="../V1notes/justice1.html">justice
of our laws</a>, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest
shadow of partiality."</p>
