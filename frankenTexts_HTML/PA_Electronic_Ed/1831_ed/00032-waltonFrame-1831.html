Soon after this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up of
the ice had destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that I could
not answer with any degree of certainty; for the ice had not
broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived
at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not
judge.</p><p>

From this time the a new spirit of life animated <a
href="../V1notes/decaying.html">the decaying frame of the stranger</a>. He
manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge
which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the
cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I
have promised that some one should watch for him, and give him instant
notice if any new object should appear in sight.</p><p>

Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the <a
href="../V1notes/present.html">present day</a>. The stranger has gradually
improved in health, but is very silent, and appears uneasy when any one
except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and
gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had
very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to <a
href="../V1notes/lovehim.html">love him as a brother</a>; and his constant
and deep grief fills me with <a href="../V1notes/sympcomp.html">sympathy
and compassion</a>. He must have been a <a
href="../V1notes/noblecre.html">noble creature</a> in his better days,
being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.</p><p>

I said in <a href="../V1notes/oneofmy.html">one of my letters</a>, my dear 
Margaret, that I should 
find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before
his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to
have possessed as the brother of my heart.</p><p>

I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
should I have any fresh incidents to record.</p>
