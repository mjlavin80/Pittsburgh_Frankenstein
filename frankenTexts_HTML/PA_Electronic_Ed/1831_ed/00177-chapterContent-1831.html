<h2 >CHAPTER XIX</h2> 
L<small>ONDON</small> was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the <a href="../V3notes/mostdist.html">most distinguished natural philosophers</a>.</p><p> 
If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. <a href="../V3notes/irksome.html">Company was irksome to me</a>; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow-men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.</p><p> 
But in Clerval I saw <a href="../V3notes/formself.html">the image of my former self</a>; he was inquisitive, and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement.  He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting <a href="../V3notes/colonise.html">the progress of European colonisation</a> and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan.  He was for ever busy; and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. <a href="../V3notes/trytocon.html">I tried to conceal</a> this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one, who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, <a href="../V3notes/remalone.html">that I might remain alone</a>. I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.</p>
