Oh! no mortal could support the <a
href="../V1notes/horror.html">horror of that countenance</a>. A mummy
again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had
gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those muscles
and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even
<a href="../V1notes/dante.html">Dante</a> could not have conceived.</p><p>

I passed the night <a href="../V1notes/wretchdy.html">wretchedly</a>.
Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly, that I felt the palpitation
of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor
and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of
disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long
a space, were now <a href="../V1notes/hell.html">become a hell</a> to me;
and the change was so rapid, the <a
href="../V1notes/ovrthrow.html">overthrow</a> so complete!</p><p>

Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless
and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its <a
href="../V1notes/steeple.html">white steeple and clock</a>, which
indicated the sixth hour. The <a href="../V1notes/porter.html">porter</a>
opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I
issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to
avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present
to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but
felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain, which poured from
<a href="../V1notes/ablack.html">a black and comfortless sky</a>.</p>
