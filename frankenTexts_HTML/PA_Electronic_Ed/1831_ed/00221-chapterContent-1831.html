Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to
reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose,
about a month after my release, I repaired to <a
href="../V3notes/crimjudg.html">a criminal judge</a> in the town,
and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I knew
the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his
whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.</p><p>

The magistrate listened to me with attention and
kindness:-- "Be assured, sir," said he, "no pains or exertions on my
part shall be spared to discover the villain."</p><p>

"I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefore, to the
deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange,
that I should fear you would not credit it, were there not
something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction.
<a href="../V3notes/story.html">The story is too connected</a> to
be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood." My
manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but calm; I had
formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to
death; and this purpose quieted my agony, and for an interval
reconciled me to life. I now related my history, briefly, but with
firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy, and
never deviating into invective or exclamation.</p><p>

The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but
as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him
sometimes shudder with horror, at others a lively surprise, <a
href="../V3notes/unming.html">unmingled with disbelief</a>, was
painted on his countenance.</p><p>

When I had concluded my narration, I said, "This is the being whom I
accuse, and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your
whole power. <a href="../V3notes/dutymag.html">It is your duty as a
magistrate</a>, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will
not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion."</p>
