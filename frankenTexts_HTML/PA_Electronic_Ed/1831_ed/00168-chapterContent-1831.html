<h2 >CHAPTER XVIII</h2> 
D<small>AY</small> after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and <a href="../V3notes/courage.html">I could not collect the courage</a> to recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed <a href="../V3notes/fiend.html">fiend</a>, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an <a href="../V3notes/engphil.html">English philosopher</a>, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and shrunk from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in me: my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most <a href="../V3notes/perfsol.html">perfect solitude</a>. <a href="../V3notes/listless.html">I passed whole days on the lake</a> alone in a little boat, watching the clouds, and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.</p><p> 
It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me:--</p><p> 
"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all."</p>
