"These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
the acquiring the <a href="../V2notes/artlang.html">art of language</a>.
My organs were indeed harsh, but supple: and although my voice was very
unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I
understood with tolerable ease. It was as <a
href="../V2notes/assdog.html">the ass and the lap-dog</a>; yet surely the
gentle ass, whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were
rude, <a href="../V2notes/deserved.html">deserved better treatment</a> 
than blows and execration.</p><p>

"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the
aspect of the earth. Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid
in caves, dispersed themselves, and were employed in various arts of
cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began
to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods,
which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My
spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of <a
href="../V2notes/nature.html">nature</a>; the <a
href="../V2notes/pastmem.html">past was blotted from my memory</a>, the
present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope, and <a
href="../V2notes/anticip.html">anticipations of joy</a>.</p>
