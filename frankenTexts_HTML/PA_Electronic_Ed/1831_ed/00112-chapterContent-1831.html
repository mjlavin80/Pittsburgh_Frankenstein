<a href="../V2notes/ireliev.html">"Thus I relieve thee</a>, my creator,"
he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me
with violence;  "thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou
canst listen to me, and grant me <a href="../V2notes/compass.html">thy
compassion</a>. By <a href="../V2notes/virtues.html">the virtues that I
once possessed</a>, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and
strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine
sensations; come to <a href="../V2notes/hut.html">the hut</a> upon the
mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide
itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate another world, you will
have heard my story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit
forever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or become the
scourge of your fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy
ruin."</p><p>

As he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed.
My heart was full, and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I
weighed the various arguments that he had used, and determined at
least to listen to his tale. I was <a href="../V2notes/partly.html">partly urged by
curiosity</a>, and
compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him
to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a
confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also,
I felt what <a href="../V2notes/thedutys.html">the duties of a creator</a> towards his
creature were,
and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his
wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We
crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The
air was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we entered the
hut, <a href="../V2notes/fiend1.html">the fiend with an air of 
exultation</a>, I with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits. But I 
consented to listen; and, seating myself by the fire which my odious 
companion had lighted, <a href="../V2notes/hethus.html">he thus
began his tale</a>.</p>
