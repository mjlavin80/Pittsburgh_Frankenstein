In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as
if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head
to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was, and wished to rouse
one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but
I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in
frightful dreams, <a href="../V3notes/danger.html">when you in
vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger</a>, and was
rooted to the spot.</p><p>

Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the
door opened, and <a href="../V3notes/wretch.html">the wretch</a>
whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me, and
said, in <a href="../V3notes/smother.html">a smothered
voice</a>--</p><p>

"You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that
you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured
toil and misery: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the
shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands, and over the
summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of
England, and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured
incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy
my hopes?"</p><p>

"Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another
like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness."</p><p>

"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you
believe yourself miserable, but <a
href="../V3notes/makewret.html">I can make you so wretched</a>
that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator,
but <a href="../V3notes/master.html">I am your master</a>; --
obey!"</p>
