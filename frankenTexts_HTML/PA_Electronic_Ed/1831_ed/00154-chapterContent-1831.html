"I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter
and stupid despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only
link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge
and hatred filled my bosom, and <a href="../V2notes/controul.html">I did
not strive to control them</a>; but, allowing myself to be borne away by
the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my
friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of
tears somewhat soothed me. But again, when I reflected that they had
spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to
injure any thing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As
night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage;
and, after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I
waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
operations.</p><p>

"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly
dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore
along like a mighty avalanche, and produced <a
href="../V2notes/insanity.html">a kind of insanity in my spirits</a>, that
burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a
tree, and danced with fury around <a href="../V2notes/devcott.html">the
devoted cottage</a>, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge
of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and
I waved my brand; it sunk, and, with a loud scream, I fired the straw, and
heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and
the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it, and
licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.</p><p>

"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any
part of the habitation, I quitted the scene, and sought for refuge
in the woods.</p>
