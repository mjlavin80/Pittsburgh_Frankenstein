On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and
one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It
contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness
of the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls
were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it
to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession; an
incident which would, doubtless, have occasioned some surprise,
had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and
squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested,
hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave;
so much does <a href="../V3notes/sufblunt.html">suffering
blunt</a> even the coarsest sensations of men.</p><p>

In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the
evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach
of the sea, to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at
my feet. It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought
of Switzerland; it was far different from this <a
href="../V3notes/appallin.html">desolate and appalling
landscape</a>. Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages
are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a
blue and gentle sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their
tumult is but as the play of a lively infant, when compared to
the roarings of the giant ocean.</p>
