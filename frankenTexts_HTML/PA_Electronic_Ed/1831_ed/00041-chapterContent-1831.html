<h2 >CHAPTER II</h2> 
W<small>E</small> were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and <a href="../V1notes/greatdis.html">the diversity and contrast</a> that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, <a href="../V1notes/allmyard.html">with all my ardour</a>, I was capable of a more intense application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial <a href="../V1notes/creation.html">creations of the poets</a>; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home -- the sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of the season; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers, -- she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in <a href="../V1notes/investig.html">investigating their causes</a>. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.</p><p> 
On the birth of <a href="../V1notes/son.html">a second son</a>, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a <i>campagne</i> on <a href="../V1notes/belrive.html">Belrive</a>, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than <a href="../V1notes/aleague.html">a league</a> from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of <a href="../V1notes/friend1.html">the closest friendship</a> to one among them. <a href="../V1notes/henry.html">Henry Clerval</a> was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.  <a href="../V1notes/enterpr3.html">He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger</a>, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of <a href="../V1notes/chivalry.html">chivalry and romance</a>. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from <a href="../V1notes/roncesva.html">the heroes of Roncesvalles</a>, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.</p><p> 
No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.</p>
