I returned home, not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors
useless whom the professor reprobated; but  
I returned, not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in  
any shape.  M. Krempe was a little <a
href="../V1notes/squatman.html">squat man</a>, with a gruff voice and a
repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and  
connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the  
conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a  
child, I had not been content with the results promised by the modern  
professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be  
accounted for by my extreme youth, and <a href="../V1notes/guide.html">my 
want of a guide</a> on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge 
along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers 
for the dreams of forgotten alchymists.  Besides, I had a <a
href="../V1notes/contempt.html">contempt for the uses of modern natural
philosophy</a>. It was very different, when the masters of the science
sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand: but
now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to <a
href="../V1notes/tolimit.html">limit itself to the annihilation of those
visions</a> on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was
required to exchange <a href="../V1notes/chimeras.html">chimeras</a> of
boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.</p><p>

Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt,  
which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities,  
and the principal residents in my new abode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And
although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow 
deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. 
Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.</p>
