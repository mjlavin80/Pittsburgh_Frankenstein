<h2 ><a href="../V1notes/preface.html">PREFACE</a>.</h2> 
T<small>HE</small> event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by <a href="../V1notes/darwin.html">Dr. Darwin</a>, and some of <a href="../V1notes/physiolo.html"> the physiological writers of Germany</a>, as not of impossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as <a href="../V1notes/merely.html">merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors</a>. The event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact, affords <a href="../V1notes/imagine.html">a point of view to the imagination</a> for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield.</p><p> 
I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature, while <a href="../V1notes/scrupled.html">I have not scrupled to innovate</a> upon their combinations. The <i>Iliad</i>, the tragic poetry of Greece, Shakespeare, in the <i>Tempest</i> and <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i> and most especially Milton, in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, conform to this rule; and the most humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from <a href="../V1notes/hislab.html">his labours</a>, may, without presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the highest specimens of poetry.</p>
