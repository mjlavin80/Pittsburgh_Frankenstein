I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? <a  href="../V3notes/midnight.html">It is midnight</a>; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise, and examine. Good night, my sister.</p><p> 
Great God! <a href="../V3notes/scene.html">what a scene has just taken  place</a>! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether  I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.</p><p> 
I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe; gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but <a  href="../V3notes/vasthand.html">one vast  hand was extended</a>, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror, and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome, yet appalling hideousness. <a href="../V3notes/shuteyes.html">I  shut my eyes involuntarily</a>, and endeavoured to recollect <a href="../V3notes/myduties.html">what were my  duties</a> with regard to this destroyer. <a  href="../V3notes/icalled.html">I called on him to stay</a>.</p><p> 
He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by <a  href="../V3notes/rage.html">the wildest rage of some uncontrollable  passion</a>.</p><p> 
"That is also my victim!" he exclaimed: "in his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! <a href="../V3notes/generous.html">generous and self-devoted being</a>! what does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovest. Alas! he is cold, he cannot answer me."</p>
