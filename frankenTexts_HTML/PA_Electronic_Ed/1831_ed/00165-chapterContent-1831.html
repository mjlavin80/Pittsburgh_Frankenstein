I paused some time <a href="../V2notes/reflect.html">to reflect</a> on all
he had related, and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought
of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his
existence, and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing
and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and
threats were not omitted in my calculations: a creature who could exist in
the ice caves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit among the
ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it
would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection, I concluded
that the <a href="../V2notes/justice3.html">justice</a> due both to him
and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his
request. Turning to him, therefore, I said--</p><p>

"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe
for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as
soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will
accompany you in your exile."</p><p>

"I swear," he cried, "<a href="../V2notes/bythesun.html">by the sun, and
by the blue sky of Heaven</a>, and by the fire of love that burns my
heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never
behold me again. Depart to your home, and commence your labours: I shall
watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when
you are ready I shall appear."</p><p> Saying this, he suddenly quitted me,
fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the
mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and <a
href="../V2notes/quickly.html">quickly lost him among the undulations of
the sea of ice</a>.</p>
