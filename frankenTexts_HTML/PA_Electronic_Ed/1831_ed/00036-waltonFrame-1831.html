"I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is useless; my <a
href="../V1notes/fate.html">fate</a> is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for
one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,"
continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; "but you are
mistaken, <a href="../V1notes/myfriend.html">my friend</a>, if thus you

record, <a href="../V1notes/asnearly.html">as nearly as possible</a> in
his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged,
I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the
greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own
lips, with what <a href="../V1notes/whatinte.html">interest</a> and
sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my
task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on
me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in
animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul
within. Strange and harrowing must be his story; frightful the storm which
embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and wrecked it -- thus!</p>
