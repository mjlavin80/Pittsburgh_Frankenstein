I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I
saw, by the light of the moon, <a
href="../V3notes/daemon.html">the d√¶mon</a> at the
casement. <a href="../V3notes/ghastly.html">A ghastly grin</a>
wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the
task which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my
travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or
taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark
my progress, and claim the fulfillment of my promise.</p><p>

As I looked on him, his <a
href="../V3notes/counten.html">countenance expressed the utmost
extent of malice and treachery</a>. I thought with a sensation of
madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and <a
href="../V3notes/tremblin.html">trembling with passion</a>, <a
href="../V3notes/tore.html">tore to pieces the thing</a> on which
I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose
future existence he depended for happiness, and, with <a
href="../V3notes/howl.html">a howl of devilish despair and
revenge</a>, withdrew.</p><p>

I left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my
own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling
steps, I sought my own apartment. <a
href="../V3notes/wasalone.html">I was alone</a>; none were near
me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from the sickening
oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p><p>

Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on
the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and
all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing
vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle
breeze wafted the sound of voices, as the <a
href="../V3notes/fisher.html">fishermen called to one
another</a>. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious
of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by
the paddling of oars near the shore, and <a
href="../V3notes/person.html">a person</a> landed close to my
house.</p>
