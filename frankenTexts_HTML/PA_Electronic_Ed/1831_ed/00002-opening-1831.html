<h2 >Introduction</h2> 
<a href="../V1notes/publish.html">The Publishers of the Standard Novels</a>, in selecting "Frankenstein" for one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with some account of the origin of the story.  I am the more willing to comply, because I shall thus give a general answer to the question, so frequently asked me -- "How I, then a <a href="../V1notes/youngirl.html">young girl</a>, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?"  It is true that I am very averse to bringing myself forward in print; but as my account will only appear as an appendage to a former production, and as it will be confined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I can scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion.</p>
