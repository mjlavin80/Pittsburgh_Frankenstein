<a href="../V2notes/devil.html">"Devil!"</a> I exclaimed, "do you dare
approach me? and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on
your <a href="../V2notes/miserabl.html">miserable head?</a> <a
href="../V2notes/begone.html">Begone, vile insect!</a> or rather stay,
that I may trample you to dust! and, oh! that I could, with the extinction
of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so
diabolically murdered!"</p><p>

"I expected this reception," said the d√¶mon. "All men hate <a
href="../V2notes/wretchd.html">the wretched</a>; how, then, must I be
hated, who am <a href="../V2notes/misbeynd.html">miserable beyond all
living things!</a> Yet you, <a href="../V2notes/mycreatr.html">my
creator</a>, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art <a
href="../V2notes/bound.html">bound by ties</a> only dissoluble by the
annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How <a
href="../V2notes/dareyou.html">dare you sport</a> thus with life? Do <a
href="../V2notes/yourduty.html">your duty</a> towards me, and I will do
mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my
conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will
glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your
remaining friends."</p><p>

"Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the <a
href="../V2notes/tortures.html">tortures of hell</a> are too mild a
vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! you reproach me with your
creation; come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so
negligently bestowed."</p><p> My rage was <a
href="../V2notes/without.html">without bounds</a>; I sprang on him,
impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence
of another.</p>
