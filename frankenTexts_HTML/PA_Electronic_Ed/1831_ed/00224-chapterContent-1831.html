<h2 >CHAPTER XXIV</h2> 
M<small>Y</small> present situation was one in which all <a href="../V3notes/voluntar.html">voluntary thought</a> was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by <a href="../V3notes/fury.html">fury</a>; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; <a href="../V3notes/modelled.html">it moulded my feelings</a>, and allowed me to be calculating and calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.</p><p> 
My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself with <a href="../V3notes/summoney.html">a sum of money, together with a few jewels</a> which had belonged to my mother, and departed.</p><p> 
And now <a href="../V3notes/mywander.html">my wanderings</a> began, <a href="../V3notes/tocease.html">which are to cease but with life</a>. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships which travellers, in <a href="../V3notes/desbarb.html">deserts and barbarous countries</a>, are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.</p><p> 
When I quitted Geneva, my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of <a href="../V3notes/myfiend.html">my fiendish enemy</a>. But my plan was unsettled; and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night approached, I found myself <a href="../V3notes/cemetery.html">at the entrance of the cemetery</a> where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it, and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Every thing was silent, except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark; and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. <a href="../V3notes/spirits.html">The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around</a>, and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.</p>
