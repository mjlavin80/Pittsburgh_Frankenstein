Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them, and then himself <a  href="../V3notes/correct.html">corrected and augmented</a> them in many places; but principally <a  href="../V3notes/giving.html">in giving  the life and spirit</a> to the conversations he held with his enemy. "Since you have preserved my narration," said he, "I would not that a <a href="../V3notes/mutilate.html">mutilated one</a> should go down to  posterity."</p><p> 
Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to <a  href="../V3notes/imagin.html">the strangest tale that ever imagination formed</a>. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up by the <a  href="../V3notes/interest.html">interest for my guest</a>, which this tale, and his own elevated and gentle manners, have created. I wish to soothe him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the <a  href="../V3notes/offspring.html">offspring of solitude and delirium</a>: he believes, that, when in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries, or <a href="../V3notes/excite.html">excitements to his  vengeance</a>, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me <a  href="../V3notes/almostas.html">almost as  imposing and interesting as truth</a>.</p><p> 
Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His <a href="../V3notes/eloquenc.html">eloquence</a> is forcible and touching;  nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident, or <a href="../V3notes/endeav.html">endeavours to move the passions</a> of pity or love, without tears. What <a href="../V3notes/glorious.html">a glorious creature</a> must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth, and the greatness of his fall.</p>
