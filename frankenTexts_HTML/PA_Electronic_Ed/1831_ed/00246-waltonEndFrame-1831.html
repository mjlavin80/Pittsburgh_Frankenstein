"After the murder of Clerval, I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror: I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness; that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me, he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat, and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture; but <a href="../V3notes/slavenot.html">I was the slave, not the master</a>, of an impulse, which I detested, yet could not disobey. Yet when she died! -- nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. <a href="../V3notes/evilgood.html">Evil thenceforth became my good</a>. Urged thus far, <a href="../V3notes/nochoice.html">I had no choice but to adapt my nature</a> to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion of <a href="../V3notes/design.html">my demoniacal design</a> became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!"</p><p> 
I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of <a href="../V3notes/eloquen3.html">his powers of eloquence and persuasion</a>, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.  "<a href="../V3notes/wretch2.html">Wretch</a>!" I said, "it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. <a href="../V3notes/torch.html">You throw a torch</a> into a pile of buildings; and, when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins, and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! if he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power."</p>
