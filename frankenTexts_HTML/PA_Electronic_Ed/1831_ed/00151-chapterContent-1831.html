<h2 >CHAPTER XVI</h2> 
"<a href="../V2notes/cursed2.html">C<small>URSED</small>, cursed creator!</a> Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had <a href="../V2notes/bestowed.html">so wantonly bestowed</a>? I know not;  despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants, and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.</p><p> 
"When night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. <a href="../V2notes/beast.html">I was like a wild beast</a> that had broken the toils; destroying the objects that obstructed me, and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. O! what a miserable night I passed! the cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me: now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment: <a href="../V2notes/hellwith.html">I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me</a>; and, finding myself <a href="../V2notes/unsymp.html">unsympathised with</a>, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.</p><p> 
"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion, and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No: from that moment I <a href="../V2notes/declared.html">declared everlasting war</a> against the species, and, more than all, against him who had formed me, and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.</p><p> 
"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.</p>
