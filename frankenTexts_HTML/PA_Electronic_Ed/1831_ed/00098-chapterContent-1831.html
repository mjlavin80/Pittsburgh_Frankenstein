"Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted
you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do
not fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt
the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.
You shall not die! -- You, my play-fellow, my companion, my sister,
perish on the scaffold! No! no! I never could survive so horrible a
misfortune."</p><p>

Justine shook her head mournfully. "I do not fear to die," she said; "that  
pang is past. <a href="../V1notes/godraise.html">God raises my weakness</a>, 
and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and 
if you remember me, and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned 
to the  fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to  
the will of Heaven!"</p>
