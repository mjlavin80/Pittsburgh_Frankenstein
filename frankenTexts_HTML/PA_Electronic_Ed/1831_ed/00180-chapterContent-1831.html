We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs,
and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were
often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We
visited the tomb of the illustrious <a
href="../People/hampden.html">Hampden</a>, and the field on which that
patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and
miserable fears, to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and
self-sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the
remembrancers. For an instant I dared <a
href="../V3notes/mychains.html">to shake off my chains</a>, and look
around me with a free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my
flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable
self.</p><p>

We left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to <a
href="../Places/matlock.html">Matlock</a>, which was our next
place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village
resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but
every thing is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the
crown of distant white Alps, which always attend on the piny
mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave, and
the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are
disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and
Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble, when pronounced by
Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible
scene was thus associated.</p><p>

From Derby, still journeying northward, we passed two months in <a
href="../V3notes/cumber.html">Cumberland and Westmoreland</a>. I
could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The
little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides
of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky
streams, were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we
made <a href="../V3notes/acquaint.html">some acquaintances</a>,
who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of
Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded
in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature
greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined
himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.
"I could pass my life here," said he to me; "and among these
mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine."</p>
