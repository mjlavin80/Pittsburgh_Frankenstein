"My dear Victor," cried he, "what, for God's sake, is the
matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the
cause of all this?"</p><p>

"Do not ask me," cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I
saw the <a href="../V1notes/dreaded.html">dreaded spectre</a> glide into
the room; "<i>he</i> can tell. -- Oh, save me! save me!" I imagined that
the
<a href="../V1notes/thismon.html">monster</a> seized me; I struggled
furiously, and fell down in a fit.</p><p>

Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he
anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was
not the witness of his grief; for I was <a
href="../V1notes/lifeless.html">lifeless</a>, and did not recover my
senses for a long, long time.</p><p>

This was the commencement of a <a href="../V1notes/nervous.html">nervous
fever, which confined me for several months</a>. During all that time <a
href="../V1notes/nurse.html">Henry was my only nurse</a>. I afterwards
learned that, knowing my father's advanced age, and <a
href="../V1notes/unfitnes.html">unfitness for so long a journey</a>, and
how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief
by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a
more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt
of my recovery, he did not doubt that, <a
href="../V1notes/instead.html">instead of doing harm</a>, he performed the
kindest action that he could towards them.</p><p>

But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and
unremitting attentions of my friend could have <a
href="../V1notes/restored.html">restored me to life</a>. The form of the
monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and
I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry: he
at first believed them to be the wanderings of my <a
href="../V1notes/disturbd.html">disturbed imagination</a>; but the
pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject,
persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and
terrible event.</p>
