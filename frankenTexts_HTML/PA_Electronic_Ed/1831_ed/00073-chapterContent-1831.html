"When my dearest aunt died, every one was too much occupied in their own
grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with
the most anxious affection. Poor <a
href="../V1notes/justinil.html">Justine was very ill</a>; but other trials
were reserved for her.</p><p>

"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
exception of her neglected daughter, was <a
href="../V1notes/childles.html">left childless</a>. The conscience of the
woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites
was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a <a
href="../V1notes/catholic.html">Roman catholic</a>; and I believe her
confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few
months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
repentant mother. Poor girl! she wept when she quitted our house; she was
much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a
winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for
vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to
restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.
She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener
accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.
Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at
first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace forever. <a
href="../V1notes/shedied.html">She died on the first approach of cold
weather</a>, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has returned to
us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,
and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expressions
continually remind me of my dear aunt.</p>
