The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, <a
href="../V1notes/heart.html">heart and soul</a>, in one pursuit. It was a
most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful
harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but <a
href="../V1notes/eyesinsn.html">my eyes were insensible to the charms of
nature</a>. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around
me caused me also <a href="../V1notes/toforget.html">to forget those
friends</a> who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so
long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well remembered the
words of my father: "I know that while you are pleased with yourself, you
will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You
must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a
proof that <a href="../V1notes/otherdut.html">your other duties are
equally neglected</a>."</p><p>

I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings; but I could not
tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which <a
href="../V1notes/hadtaken.html">had taken an irresistible hold of my
imagination</a>. I wished, as it were, to <a
href="../V1notes/procrast.html">procrastinate all that related to my
feelings of affection</a> until the great object, which swallowed up every
habit of my nature, should be completed.</p>
