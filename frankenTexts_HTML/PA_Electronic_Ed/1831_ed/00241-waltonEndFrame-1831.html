September 9th, the ice began to move, and <a href="../V3notes/roarings.html">roarings like thunder</a> were heard at a distance, as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were in the most imminent peril; but, as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest, whose illness increased in such a degree, that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us, and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprung from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this, and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, <a href="../V3notes/shout.html">a shout of tumultuous joy</a> broke from them, loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke, and asked the cause of the tumult. "They shout," I said, "because they will soon return to England."</p><p> 
"Do you then really return?"</p><p> 
"Alas! yes; I cannot withstand their demands. <a href="../V3notes/lead.html">I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger</a>, and I must return."</p><p> 
"Do so, if you will; but <a href="../V3notes/iwillnot.html">I will not</a>.  You may give up your purpose, but <a href="../V3notes/assign.html">mine is assigned to me by Heaven</a>, and I dare not. I am weak; but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength." Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back, and fainted.</p><p> 
It was long before he was restored; and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty, and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him <a href="../V3notes/compose.html">a composing draught</a>, and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the mean time he told me, that my friend had not many hours to live.</p>
