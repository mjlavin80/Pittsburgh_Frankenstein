<p>

When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in
the hall of our villa, a child fairer than pictured cherub -- a creature
who seemed to shed radiance from her looks, and whose form and motions
were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon
explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians
to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her
presence had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to
keep her in poverty and want, when Providence afforded her such powerful
protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was, that
<a href="../V1notes/elizabe1.html">Elizabeth Lavenza</a> became the inmate 
of my parents' house -- my more than sister -- the beautiful and adored 
companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.</p><p>

Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential
attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it,
my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being
brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, -- 'I have a
pretty present for my Victor -- to-morrow he shall have it.' And
when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her
promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her
words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as <a
href="../V1notes/possessn.html">mine -- mine to protect, love,
and cherish.</a> All praises bestowed on her, I received as made
to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the
name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind
of relation in which she stood to me -- my more than sister,
since till death she was to be mine only.</p>
