We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through <a
href="../Places/coupar.html">Coupar</a>, <a
href="../V3notes/standrew.html">St. Andrew's</a>, and along the
banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I
was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into
their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a
guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make <a
href="../V3notes/tourscot.html">the tour of Scotland alone</a>.
"Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and let this be our
rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere
with my motions, I entreat you: leave me to peace and solitude
for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a
lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper."</p><p>

Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this
plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. "I
had rather be with you," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than
with these Scotch people, whom I do not know: hasten then, my
dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at
home, which I cannot do in your absence."</p><p>

Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some
remote spot of Scotland, and finish my work in solitude. I did
not doubt but that the monster followed me, and would discover
himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his
companion.</p><p>

With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands, and
fixed on <a href="../V3notes/orkney.html">one of the remotest of
the Orkneys</a> as the scene of my labours. It was a place
fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock, whose high
sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was
barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and
oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons,
whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable
fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries,
and even fresh water, was to be procured from <a
href="../V3notes/mainland.html">the main land</a>, which was
about five miles distant.</p>
