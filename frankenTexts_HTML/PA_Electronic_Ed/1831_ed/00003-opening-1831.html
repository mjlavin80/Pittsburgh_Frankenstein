It is not singular that, as <a href="../V1notes/daughter.html">the
daughter of two persons of distinguished literary celebrity</a>, I should
very early in life have thought of writing. As a child I scribbled; and my
favourite pastime, during the hours given me for recreation, was to "write
stories."  Still I had a dearer pleasure than this, which was the
formation of castles in the air -- the indulging in waking dreams -- the
following up trains of thought, which had for their subject the formation
of <a href="../V1notes/imaginar.html">a succession of imaginary
incidents</a>.  My dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than
my writings.  In the latter I was a close imitator -- rather doing as
others had done, than putting down the suggestions of my own mind.  What I
wrote was intended at least for one other eye -- <a
href="../V1notes/mychild.html">my childhood's companion and friend</a>; 
but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody; they were
my refuge when annoyed -- my dearest pleasure when free.</p>
