"Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they
entered into conversation, using <a href="../V2notes/violent.html">violent
gesticulations</a>; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke
<a href="../V2notes/lang2.html">the language of the country</a>, which
differed from that of <a href="../V2notes/protect.html">my protectors</a>.
Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man: I was surprised,
as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited
anxiously to discover, from his discourse, the meaning of these unusual
appearances.</p><p>

"'Do you consider,' said <a href="../V2notes/companio.html">his
companion</a> to him, 'that you will be obliged to pay three months' rent,
and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair
advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of
your determination.'</p><p>

"'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix, 'we can never again inhabit your
cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the
dreadful circumstance that I have related. <a
href="../V2notes/mywife.html">My wife</a> and my sister will never recover
their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take
possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this place.'</p><p>

"Felix trembled <a href="../V2notes/violent2.html">violently</a> as he
said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they
remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of <a
href="../V2notes/delacey.html">the family of De Lacey</a> more.</p>
