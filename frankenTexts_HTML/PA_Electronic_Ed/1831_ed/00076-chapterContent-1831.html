M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of 
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me 
even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. "D--n the 
fellow!" cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us 
all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster 
who, but a few years ago, believed in <a 
href="../People/agrippa.html">Cornelius Agrippa</a> as firmly as in the
gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is
not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance. -- Ay, ay,"
continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, "M. Frankenstein
is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be
diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young;
but that wears out in a very short time."</p><p>

M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which
happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so
annoying to me.</p><p>

Clerval had never sympathised in my  
tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly  
from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the  
design of <a href="../V1notes/langwere.html">making himself complete master of the oriental languages</a>,  as thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out  
for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his  
eyes toward the East, as affording <a href="../V1notes/enterpr4.html">scope 
for his spirit of enterprise</a>. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanscrit 
languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on 
the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I 
wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great 
relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only 
instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, 
like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not 
contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read 
merely  to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their 
melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating to a degree I never 
experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read 
their writings, life appears to consist in a warm <a 
href="../V1notes/sunand.html">sun and a garden</a> of roses, in
<a href="../V1notes/fairenem.html">the smiles and frowns of a fair 
enemy</a>, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from 
the <a href="../V1notes/manpoem.html">manly and heroical poetry</a> of 
Greece and Rome!</p>
