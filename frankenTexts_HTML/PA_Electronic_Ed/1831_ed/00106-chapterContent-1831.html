<h2 >CHAPTER X</h2> 
I <small>SPENT</small> the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the sources of the <a href="../V2notes/arveiron.html">Arveiron</a>, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills, to barricade the valley.  The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around;  and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves, or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche, or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling; and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine; the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds -- they all gathered round me, and bade me be at peace.</p><p> 
Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil, and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to <a href="../V2notes/montanv.html">the summit of Montanvert</a>. I remembered the effect that the view of the <a href="../V2notes/tremendo.html">tremendous and ever-moving glacier</a> had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The sight of <a href="../V2notes/thaweful.html">the awful and majestic</a> in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. <a href="../V2notes/goalone.html">I determined to go without a guide</a>, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.</p>
