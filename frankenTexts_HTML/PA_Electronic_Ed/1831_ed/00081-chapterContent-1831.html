"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When
she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that
that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very
valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This
picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the
murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present,
although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they
will not restore my beloved William!</p><p>

"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She
weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of
his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but
will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return
and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say,
Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death
of her youngest darling!</p><p>

"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of
festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my
friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and <a

"Your affectionate and afflicted father,</p><p>

A<small>LPHONSE</small> F<small>RANKENSTEIN</small>.</p><p>

"Geneva, May 12th, 17--."</p>
