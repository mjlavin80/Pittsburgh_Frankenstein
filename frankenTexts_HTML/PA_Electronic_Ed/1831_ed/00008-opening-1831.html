<p>

I busied myself <i>to think of a story</i>, -- a story to rival
those which had excited us to this task.  One which would speak
to the mysterious fears of our nature, and awaken thrilling
horror -- one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle
the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart.  If I did not
accomplish these things, my ghost story would be unworthy of its
name.  I thought and pondered -- vainly.  I felt <a
href="../V1notes/blankinc.html">that blank
incapability of invention</a> which is the greatest misery of
authorship, when dull Nothing replies to our anxious invocations.
<i>Have you thought of a story?</i> I was asked each morning, and
each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative.</p>
