I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued,
and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my
mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of
my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the work of my own
hands alive at my bedside; its departure. Two years had now nearly
elapsed since the night on which <a href="../V1notes/depart.html">he</a>
first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned
loose into the world a <a href="../V1notes/depraved.html">depraved
wretch</a>, whose delight was in carnage and misery; <a
href="../V1notes/notmurdr.html">had he not murdered</a> my brother?</p><p>

No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the
night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel
the inconvenience of the weather; my <a
href="../V1notes/imag.html">imagination was busy in scenes of evil and
despair</a>. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and
endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the
deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of <a
href="../V1notes/vampire.html">my own vampire</a>, <a
href="../V1notes/ownspirt.html">my own spirit</a> let loose from the
grave, and <a href="../V1notes/forced.html">forced to destroy</a> all that
was dear to me.</p><p>

Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open,
and I hastened to my father's house. My first thought was to discover what
I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused
when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself
had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the
precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the <a
href="../V1notes/nervfev.html">nervous fever</a> with which I had been
seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an
air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew
that <a href="../V1notes/anyother.html">if any other had communicated such
a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of
insanity</a>. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all
pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to
commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a
creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont SalÃªve?
These reflections determined me, and I <a
href="../V1notes/resolved.html">resolved to remain silent</a>.</p>
