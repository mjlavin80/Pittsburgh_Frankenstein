The day of my departure at length arrived.  Clerval spent the last  
evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade <a 
href="../V1notes/hispap.html">his father</a> to permit  
him to accompany me, and to become my fellow student; but in vain.  
His father was a narrow-minded <a href="../V1notes/trader.html">trader</a>, 
and saw idleness and ruin in  the aspirations and ambition of his son. 
Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal 
education. He said  little; but when he spoke, I read in his kindling 
eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve, not to be 
chained to the miserable details of commerce.</p><p>

We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor  
persuade ourselves to say the word "Farewell!" It was said; and we  
retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the  
other was deceived: but when at morning's dawn I descended to the  
carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there -- my  
father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my  
Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often, and to  
bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.</p><p>

I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in
the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
pleasure, <a href="../V1notes/iwasnow.html">I was now alone</a>. In the
university, whither I was going, I must form my own friends, and be my own
protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic; and
this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my
brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were "<a
href="../V1notes/oldfam.html">old familiar faces</a>;" but I believed
myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my
reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and
hopes rose. <a href="../V1notes/iardent.html">I ardently desired</a> the
acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to
remain during my youth cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the
world, and take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were
complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.</p>
