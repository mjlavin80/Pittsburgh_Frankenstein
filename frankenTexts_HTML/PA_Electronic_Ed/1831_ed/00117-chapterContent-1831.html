"It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun, which
shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels;
and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in <a
href="../V2notes/awallet.html">a wallet</a> I found, I proceeded across
the fields for <a href="../V2notes/several.html">several hours</a>, until
at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! the
huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration by
turns. The <a href="../V2notes/vegetabl.html">vegetables in the
gardens</a>, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some
of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered;
but I had hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children
shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village was
roused; some
fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other
kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully
took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance
after the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel, however, joined
a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance; but, after my late dearly
bought experience, <a href="../V2notes/notenter.html">I dared not enter
it</a>. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low, that I
could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on
the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind
entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the
snow and rain.</p><p>

"Here then I retreated, and lay down happy to have found a shelter,
however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from
<a href="../V2notes/inclemen.html">the barbarity of man</a>.</p><p>

"As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel, that I might view the
adjacent cottage, and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had
found. It was situated against the back of the cottage, and surrounded on
the sides which were exposed by a pig-stye and a clear pool of water. One
part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice
by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner
that I might move them on occasion to pass out: <a
href="../V2notes/allthe.html">all the light I enjoyed came through the
stye</a>, and that was <a href="../V2notes/sufficen.html">sufficient</a>
for me.</p>
