<a href="../V1notes/curio.html">Partly from curiosity</a>, and partly from 
idleness, I went into the lecturing
room, which <a href="../V1notes/waldmann.html">M. Waldman</a> entered
shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared
about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back
of his head were nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect;
and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a
recapitulation of the history of chemistry, and the various improvements
made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of
the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the
present state of the science, and explained many of its elementary terms.
After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a
panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never
forget:--</p><p>

"The ancient teachers of this science," said he, "promised
impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very
little; they know that <a href="../V1notes/metals.html">metals cannot be
transmuted, and that the elixir of life</a> is a chimera. But these
philosophers, <a href="../V1notes/whosehan.html">whose hands seem only
made to dabble in dirt</a>, and their eyes to pore over the <a
href="../V1notes/microscp.html">microscope</a> or <a
href="../V1notes/crucible.html">crucible</a>, have indeed performed
miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature, and show how she
works in her hiding places. They <a href="../V1notes/ascend.html">ascend
into the heavens</a>: they have discovered how the <a
href="../V1notes/blood.html">blood circulates</a>, and the <a
href="../V1notes/natureof.html">nature of the air we breathe</a>. They
have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the
thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible
world with its own shadows."</p>
