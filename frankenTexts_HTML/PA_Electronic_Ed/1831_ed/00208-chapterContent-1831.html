A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I
received the following letter from Elizabeth:--</p><p>

"My dear Friend,</p><p>

"It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my
uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance,
and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor
cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see you
looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter
has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by
anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance,
and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and
tranquillity.</p><p>

"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so
miserable <a href="../V3notes/yearago.html">a year ago</a>, even
perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at this period,
when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation that
I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some
explanation necessary before we meet.</p><p>

"Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to
explain? If you really say this, my questions are answered, and
all my doubts satisfied.
But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may <a
href="../V3notes/dread.html">dread, and yet be pleased</a> with
this explanation; and, in a probability of this being the case, I
dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I
have often wished to express to you, but have never had the
courage to begin.</p>
