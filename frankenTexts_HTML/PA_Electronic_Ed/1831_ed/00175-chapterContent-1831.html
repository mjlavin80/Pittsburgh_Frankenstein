<blockquote>

------  "The sounding cataract<br/>
Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,<br/>
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<br/>
Their colours and their forms, were then to him<br/>
An appetite; a feeling, and a love,<br/>
That had no need of a remoter charm,<br/>
By thought supplied, or any interest<br/>
Unborrow'd from the eye"<sup>*</sup>

And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever? 
Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and
magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of
its <a href="../V3notes/creator.html">creator</a>; -- has this mind <a
href="../V3notes/perished.html">perished</a>?  Does it now only exist in
my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming
with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your
unhappy friend.</p><p>

Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a
slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe
my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his <a
href="../V3notes/remembra.html">remembrance</a> creates. <a
href="../V3notes/proceed.html">I will proceed with my
tale</a>.</p>
