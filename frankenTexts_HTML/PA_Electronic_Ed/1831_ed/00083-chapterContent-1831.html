Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed
themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But
now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a <a
href="../V1notes/cabriole.html">cabriole</a>, and bade farewell to my
friend.</p><p>

My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I
longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but
when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly
sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed
through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly
six years. How altered every thing might be during that time? One sudden
and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; <a
href="../V1notes/darenot.html">I dared not advance</a>, dreading a
thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to
define them.</p><p>

I remained two days at <a href="../Places/lausanne.html">Lausanne</a>, in
this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were
placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, <a
href="../V1notes/palaces.html">"the palaces of nature,"</a> were not
changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I
continued my journey towards Geneva.</p><p>

The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I
approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly <a
href="../V1notes/blacksid.html">the black sides of Jura</a>, and the <a
href="../V1notes/bright.html">bright summit of Mont
Blanc</a>; I wept like a child. "Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake!
how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake
are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to <a
href="../V1notes/mock.html">mock at my unhappiness</a>?"</p>
