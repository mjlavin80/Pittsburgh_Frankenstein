Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage
with Elizabeth. I remained silent.</p><p>

"Have you, then, some other attachment?"</p><p>

"None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union
with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will
consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my
cousin."</p><p>

"My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have
befallen us; but let us only cling closer to what remains, and
transfer our love for those whom we have lost, to those who yet
live. <a href="../V3notes/ourcirc.html">Our circle will be
small</a>, but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual
misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, <a
href="../V3notes/newdear.html">new and dear objects of care will
be born</a> to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
deprived."</p><p>

Such were <a href="../V3notes/lessons.html">the lessons of my
father</a>. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned: nor
can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his
deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible; and
that when he had pronounced the words, "<i>I shall be with you on
your wedding-night</i>," I should regard <a
href="../V3notes/unavoid.html">the threatened fate as
unavoidable</a>. But death was no evil to me, if the loss of
Elizabeth were balanced with it; and I therefore, with a
contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father,
that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place
in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.</p><p>

Great God! if for one instant I had thought what might be the
hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have
banished myself for ever from my native country, and <a
href="../V3notes/outcast.html">wandered a friendless outcast over
the earth</a>, than have consented to this miserable marriage.
But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me
to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared
only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.</p>
