I will add but one word as to the alterations I have made.  They are
principally those of style.  <a href="../V1notes/changed.html">I have
changed no portion of the story</a>, nor introduced any new ideas or
circumstances.  I have mended the language where it was so bald as to
interfere with the interest of the narrative; and these changes occur
almost exclusively in the beginning of the first volume.  Throughout they
are entirely confined to such parts as are mere adjuncts to the story,
leaving the core and substance of it untouched.
