Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are
we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if
this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate
suggestion of <a href="../V1notes/guardian.html">the guardian angel of my
life</a> -- the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert
the storm that was even then hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope
me.  Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of
soul, which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly
tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil
with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.</p><p>

It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual.
Destiny was too potent, and immutable laws had decreed my utter and
terrible destruction.</p>
