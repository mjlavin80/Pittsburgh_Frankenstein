site mountains, whose summits were
hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
poured from the dark sky, and added
to the melancholy impression I received
from the objects around me. Alas!
why does man boast of sensibilities su-
perior to those apparent in the brute;
it only renders them more necessary
beings. If our impulses were conﬁned
to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might
be nearly free; but now we are moved
by every wind that blows, and a chance
word or scene that that word may con—
vey to us.

We rest, a dream has power to poison sleep
We rise- , one wand’ ring thought pollutes the day.
We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
- The path of its departure still is free. ,
Mail's yesterday may ne'er be lilie his morrow;
Nought may endure but mutability !
