156 FRANKENSTEIN ; on;

town for an apothecary, but life was
quite gone.

Several other men were examined
concerning my landing; and they
agreed, that, ivith the strong north
Wind that had arisen during the night,
it was very probable that I had beaten
about for many hours, and had been
obliged to return nearly to the same
spot from which Ihad departed. BeÂ»
sides, they observed that it appeared
that I had brought the body from an-
other place, and it Was likely, that as
.I did not appear to know the shore,1
might have put into the harbour igno-
rant of the distance of the town of
from the place where I had de-
posited the corpse.

Mr. Kirwink on hearing this evi-
dence, desired that I should be taken
into the room where the body lay fOI
interment, that it might be observed
