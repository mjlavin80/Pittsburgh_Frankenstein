THE Monnnx ruoms'rmaus. 89

hours of despondency and solitude; but
when I contemplated the virtues of the
cottagers, their amiable and benevolent . *
dispositions, I persuaded myself that
when they should become acquainted
with my admiration‘of their virtues,
they would compassionate me, and over-
look my personal deformity. Could they
turn from their door one, however mon-
strous, who solicited their compassion
and friendship? I resolved, at least,
not to despair, but in every way to ﬁt
myself for an interview with them which
would decide my fate. I postponed
this attempt for some months longer;
for the importance attached to its suc-r
cess inspired me with a dread lest I
should fail. Besides, I found that my
understanding improved so much with
every day’s experience, that I was un-
willing to commence this undertaking
until a few more months should have
added to my wisdom.‘
