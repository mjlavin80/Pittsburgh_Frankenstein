surprised at my misery, you will only
wonder that I survive what I have eril
dured._ 'I will conﬁde this tale of misery
and'terror to you the day after our mar-
riage shall take place; for,'my sweet
cousin, there must be perfect conﬁdence
between us. But until then, I conjure
you, do not mention or allude to it.
This I most earnestly entreat, and]
know you will comply.”

In about a week after the arrival of
Elizabeth’s letter, we returned to Ge-

neva. My cousin welcomed me with

Warm aﬁ'ection; yet tears were in her
eyes,‘as she beheld my emaciated frame
and feverish cheeks. I saw a change
in her also. She was thinner, and had
lost much of that heavenly vivacity that
had before charmed me; but her gen-
tleness, and soft looks of compassion.
made her a more ﬁt companion for one
blasted and miserable as I was. '
