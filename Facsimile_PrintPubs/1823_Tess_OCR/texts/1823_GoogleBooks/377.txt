104 FRANKENSTEIN ; on,

larly to the water, casting black and im-
penetrable shades, which would cause
a gloomy and mournful appearance,
were it not for the most verdant islands
that relieve the eye by their gay appear-
ance; I have seen this lake agitated
by a tempest, when' the wind tore up
whirlwinds of water, and gaveyou an
idea of what the water-spout must be
on the great ocean, and the waves dash
with fury the base'of the mountain,
where the priest and his mistress were
overwhelmed by an avel√©nche, and
where their dying voices are still said
to be heard amid the pauses of the
nightly wind; I have seen the moun-
tains of La Valais, and the Pays de
Vaud . but this country, Victor, pleases
me more than all those wonders. The
mountains of Switzerland are more
majestic and strange; but there is a
charm in the banks of this divine rivers
