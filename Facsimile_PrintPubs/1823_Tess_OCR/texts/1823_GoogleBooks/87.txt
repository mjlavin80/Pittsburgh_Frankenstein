68 . FRANKENSTEIN ; on,

these were “old familiar faces ;” but I
believed myself totally unﬁtted for the
company of strangers. Such were my
reﬂections as I commenced my journey;
but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes
rose. I ardently delired the acquisi-
tion'of knowledge. I had often, when
at home, thought it hard to remain du‘
ring my youth moped up in one place,
and had longed to enter the world, and
take my station among other human
beings. Now my desires were complied
with, and it would, indeed, have been
folly to repent. ’

I had suﬂicient leisure for these and
many other reﬂections during my jour—
ney to Ingolstadt, which was long and
fatiguing. At length the high white
steeple of the town met my eyes. I
alighted, and was conducted to my SOr

litary apartment, to spend the evening
as” I pleased.
