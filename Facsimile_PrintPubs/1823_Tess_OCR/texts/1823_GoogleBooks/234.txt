ﬁeld also, and half-frightened, as it were
instinctively, .ﬁnding myself so deso-
late. Before I had quitted your apart-
ment,‘ on a sensation of cold, I had 00‘.
vered myself with some clothes; but
these were insu’tﬁCient to secure -me
from the dews of‘ night. I was a poor,
llelpless,‘ miserable wretch; Iknew, and /
could'dis‘tinguish, nothing; but feeling
pain invade me on all sides, I sat down
and wept.

“Soon a gentle light stole over the
heavens, and gave me a sensation of
pleasure.‘ I started up, and beheld a
radiant form rise from among the trees ‘.
I ga‘zad with a-kind ofrwonder. It
moved slowly, but -it enlightened my
path ; “and l againiwent out‘in search of
berries.- I Was still cold, when under
