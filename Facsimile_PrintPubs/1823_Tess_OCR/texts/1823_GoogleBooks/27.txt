and my spirits are often depressed. I
am about to proceed on a long and dif—
ﬁcult voyage; the emergencies of which
will demand all my fortitude: I am re-
quired not only to raise the spirits of
others, but sometimes to sustain my
own, when their’s are failing.

This is the most favourable period for
travelling in Russia. They ﬂy quickly
over the snow in their sledges; the mo-
tion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far
more agreeable than that of~an English
stagevcoach. The cold is not excessive,
if you are wrapt in furs, a dress which
‘I have already adopted; for there is a
'great difference between walking the
deck and remaining seated motionless
for hours, when no exercise prevents
the blood from actually freezing in your
veins. I have no ambition to lose my
life on the past-road between St. Peters-
burgh and Archangel.
