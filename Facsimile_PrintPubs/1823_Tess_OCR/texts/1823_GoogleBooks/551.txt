die. Ishall no longer feel the agonies
which now 'consume me, or he the
prey of feelings unsatisﬁed, yet uni
quenched. He is dead who called me
into being; and when I shall be no
more, the very remembrance of us
both will speedily vanish. I shall no
longer see the sun or stars, or feel the
Winds play on my cheeks. Light, feel!
ing, and sense, will pass away; andrin
this condition must I ﬁnd my happi-
ness. Some years ago, when theimages
which this world aﬁ'ords ﬁrst open-
ed upon me, when I felt the cheer-
ing warmth of summer, and heard the
rustling of the leaves and the wathling
of the birds, and these were all to me,
I should have wept to die; now it
is my only ‘consolation. . Polluted by
crimes, and torn 'by the bitterest re-
morse, where can I ﬁnd rest but in
death ?
