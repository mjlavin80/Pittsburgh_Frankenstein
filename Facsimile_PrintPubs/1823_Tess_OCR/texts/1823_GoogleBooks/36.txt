um MODERN mommunns. 17

Shall I meet you again, after having
traversed immense seas, and returned
by the most southern cape of Africa or
America? I dare not expect such suc-
cess, yet I cannot hear to look on the
reverse of the picture. Continue to
write to me by every opportunity: I
may receive your letters (though the
chance is very doubtful) on some occa-
sions when I need them most to support
my spirits. I love you very tenderly.
Remember me with affection, should
you never hear from me again.

Your dï¬‚'ectionate brother,
ROBERT WALTON.
