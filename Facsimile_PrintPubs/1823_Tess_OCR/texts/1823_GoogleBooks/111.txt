92 FRANKENSTEIN; on,

The summer months passed while I
was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
one pursuit. It was a most beautiful
season; never did the ﬁelds bestow. a
more plentiful harvest, or the vines
yield a more luxuriant vintage : but my
eyes were insensible to the charms of
nature. And the same feelings which
made me neglect the scenes around me
caused me also to forget those friends
who were IO many miles absent, and
whom I had not seen for so long a
time. I knew my silence disquieted
them; and I well remembered the ‘
words of my father: “ I know that
while you are pleased with yourself, you
will think of us with aﬁection,» andWe
shall bear regularly from you. {You
must pardon melif I regard any inter-
ruption in your correspondence asa
proof that your other duties are equally
neglected.”
