vengeance in his death. And do Idare
to ask of you to undertake my pilgrim-
age, to endure the hardships that I have
undergone ?" No: I am not‘ so selﬁsh.
Yet, when 1 am dead, 'if he should
appear; if the ministers‘of vengeance
should conduct him to you; swear that
he shall not live—swear that he shall
not triumph over my accumulated woes,
and survive to make another such wretch
as I am. He is eloquent and persuasive;
arid once his Words had even power over
my heart: but trust him not. His soul
is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
and ﬁend-like malice. Hear him not;
call on the manes of William, Justine»
Clerval, Elizabeth, my father: and 0f
the wretched Victor, and .thrust your
sword into his heart. I will hover near.
and direct the steel aright. ”
