14-4- FRANKENSTEIN; on,

anxiety any encounter with my fellow-
creatures. At one time the moon, which
had before been clear, was suddenly
roverspread by a thick cloud, and I
took advantage of the moment of dark-
ness, and cast my basket into the sea:
I listened to the gurgling sound as it
sunk, and then sailed away from the
spot. ‘ The sky became Clouded; ,but
the air was pure, although chilled by
the north-east breeze that was then
rising. But it refreshed me, and ﬁlled
me with such agreeable sensations, that
I resolved to prolong my stay on ‘the
water, and, ﬁxing the rudder in a. direct
nosition, stretched myself it the bottom
of the boat. Clouds hid the moon,
every thing was. obscure, and I heard
only the sound of the boat, as its keel
cut through the waves; the murmur
lulled me, and in a short time I slept
soundly. '
