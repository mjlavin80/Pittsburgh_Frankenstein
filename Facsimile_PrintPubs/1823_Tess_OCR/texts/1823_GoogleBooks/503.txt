My life, as it passed thus, was indeed
hateful to me, and it was during.sleep
alone that I could taste joy. ,0 blessed
sleep! often, when most miserable,l
sank to repose, and my dreams lulled
me even to rapture. The spirits that
guarded me had provided these mo?
ments, or rather hours, of happiness,
that I might retain strength to fulﬁl my
pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite,l
shc'mld have sunk under my hardships.
During the day I was sustained and his
spirited by the hope of night _: .for in
sleep .1 saw my friends, my wife, and
my beloved country; again I sawthe
benevolent countenance of my father,
heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s
voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health
and youth. Often, when weariedbya
‘ toilsome march, I persuaded myself that
I-was dreaming until night should come;
and that I should then enjoy reality 5“
