At that instant my father entered. I
saw unhappiness deeply impressed on
his countenance, but he endeavoured to
welcome me cheerfully; and, after we
had exchanged our mournful greeting,
would have introduced some other topic
than that of our disaster, had not Ernest
exclaimed, “Good God, papa! Victor
says that he knows who Was the mur-
derer of poor William.”

“ We do also, unfortunately,” replied
my father; “ for indeed I had~rather
have been for ever ignorant than have
discovered so much depravity and in-
gratitude in one I valued so highly.”

“ My dear father, you are mistaken;
Justine is innocent.”

“ If she is, God forbid that she should
suffer as guilty. She is to be tried to-
day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that
she will be acquitted. "
