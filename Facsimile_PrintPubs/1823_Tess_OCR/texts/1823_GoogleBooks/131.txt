119. FRANKENSTEIN; on,

gloom disappeared, and in a short time
I became as cheerful as before I was
attacked by the fatal passion.

“ Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I,
“ how kind, how very good you are to
me. This whole Winter, instead of
being spent in study, as you promised
yourself, has been consumed in ‘my
sick room. How shall I ever repay
you? I feel the greatest remorse for
the disappointment of which I have
been the occasion; but you will for-
give me.”

“ You will repay me entirely, if you
do not discompose yourself, but get
well as fast as you can; and since you
appear in such good spirits, I may
speak to you on one subject, may I
not F”

I ti‘embled. One subject! what-could
it be? Could he allude to an object on
whom I dared not even think?
