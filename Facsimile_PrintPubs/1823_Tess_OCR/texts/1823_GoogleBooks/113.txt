9t FRANKENSTEIN; on,

study to which you apply yourself has
a tendency to weaken your aﬁ'ections.
and to destroy your taste for those
simple pleasures in which no alloy can
possibly mix, then that study is cer-
tainly unlawful, that is to sayfuot be-
ﬁtting the human mind. If this rule.
were always observed; if no man al-
lowed any pursuit whatsoever to inter-
fere with the tranquillity of his domestic
affections, Greece had not been eu-
slaved; Caesar would have spared his
country; America would have been dis-
covered more gradually; and the em-
pires of Mexico and Peru had not been
destroyed.

But I forget that I am moraliziug in
the most interesting part of my tale;
and your looks remind me to proceed.

My father made no reproach in his-
letters, and only took notice of my Si-
lence by inquiring into my occupations.
