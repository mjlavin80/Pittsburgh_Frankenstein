24 FRANKENSTEIN; on,

the vessel, apparently talking to some
one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge,
like that we had seen before, which had
drifted towards us in the night, on a
large fragment of ice. Only one dog
remained alive; but there was a human
being within it, whom the sailors were
persuading to enter the vessel. He was
not, as the other traveller seemed to be,
a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered
island, but an European. When I ap-
peared'on deck, the master said, “ Here
is our captain, and he will not allow
you to perish on the open sea.”

On perceiving me, the stranger ad-
dressed me in English, although with
a foreign accent. “ Before I come on
board your vessel,” said he, “ will you
have the kindness to inform me whither
you are bound ?”

You may conceive my astonishment
