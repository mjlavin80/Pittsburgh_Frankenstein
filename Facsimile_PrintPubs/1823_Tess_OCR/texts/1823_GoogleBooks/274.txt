FRANKENSTEIN;

lTHE MODERN PROMETHEUS.

 

CHAPTER I.

“I Now hasten to the more moving
part of my story. I shall relate events,
that impressed me with feelings which,
from what I had been, have made me
what I am.

“ Spring advanced rapidly; the wea-
thervbecame ﬁne, and the skies cloud-
less. It surprised me, that what before
was desert and gloomy should noiv
bloom with the most beautiful ﬂowers
‘and verdure. My senses were gratiﬁed ~
and refreshed by a thousand scents of
.delight, and a thousand sights of
beauty.
