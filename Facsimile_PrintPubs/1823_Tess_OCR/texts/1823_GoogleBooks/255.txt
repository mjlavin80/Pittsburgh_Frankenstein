236: FRANKENSTEIN; on,

went apart, and appeared to weep. I
saw no cause for their unhappiness;
but I was deeply aﬁ‘ected by it. If
such lovely creatures were miserable,
it was less strange that I, an imperfect
and solitary being, should be wretched.
Yet why were these gentle beings un—
happy? They possessed a delightful
house (for such it was in my eyes) and
every luxury; they had a ﬁre to warm
them when chill, and delicious viands
when hungry; they were dressed in
excellent clothes; and, still more, they
enjoyed one another’s company and
speech, interchanging each, day looks
of affection and kindness. What did
their tears imply ? Did they really ex-
press pain? I was at ﬁrst unable to
solve these questions; but perpetual at-
tention and time explained to me many

appearances which were at ﬁrst enig-
matic. ‘
