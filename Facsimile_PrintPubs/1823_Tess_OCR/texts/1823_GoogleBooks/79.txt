60 FRANKENSTEIN ; on,

from his infancy, through which Eliza.
beth and I had been his constant nurses;
his disposition was gentle, but he was
incapable of any severe application.
William, the youngest of our family, was
yet an infant, and the most beautiful
little fellow in the world ; his lively blue
eyes, dimpled cheeks, and endearing
manners, inspired the tenderest aÔ¨Å'ec-
tion.

Such was our domestic circle,- from
which care and pain seemed for ever
banished. My father directed our stu-
dies, and my mother partook of our en-
joyments. Neither of us possessed the
slightest pre-eminence over the other;
the voice of command was never heard
amongst us; but mutual affection eu-
gaged us all to comply with and obey
the slightest desireof each other.
