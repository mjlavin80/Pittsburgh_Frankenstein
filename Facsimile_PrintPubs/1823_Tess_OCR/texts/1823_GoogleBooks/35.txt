16 runmxsnam ; on

in my resolutions. Those are as ﬁxed
as fate; and my voyage is only now
delayed until the weather shall permit
my embarkation. The winter has been
dreadfully severe; but the spring pro-_
mises well, and it is considered as a
remarkably early season; so that per- ,
haps I may sail sooner than I expected.
I shall donothing rashly: you know
me sufﬁciently to conﬁde in my pru-
dence and consideraten'ess whenever the
safety of others is committed to my care-I

I cannot describe to you my sensa—
tions on the near prospect of my under—
taking. It is impossible to communicate
to you a conception of the trembling
sensation, half pleasurable and half fear-
ful, with which I am preparing to depart.
I am going to unexplored regions, to
“ the land of mist and snow;” but I
shall kill no»albatross, therefore do not
be alarmed, for my safety.
