THE MODERN PROMETBEUS. 118

“ Compose yourself,” said Clerval,
who observed my change of colour, “I
will not mention it‘ if it agitates you ,
but your father and cousin would be
very happy if they received a lette1 from
you in your own hand- writing. They
hardly know how ill you have been, and
are uneasy at your long silence.”

“Is that all? my dear Henry. How

could you suppose that my ﬁrst thought
would not ﬂy towards those dear, dear
friends Whom I love, and who are so de-
serving of my love.”
. “ If this is your present temper, my
friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a
letter that has been lying here some
days for you: it is from your cousinr I
believe.”
