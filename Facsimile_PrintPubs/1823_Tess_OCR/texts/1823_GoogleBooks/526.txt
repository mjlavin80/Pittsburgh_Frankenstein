. lmsbandrand lovely children; you may

you'so !' ,

'My unfortunate guest regards ‘11“:
with the tenderest campassion. He
endeavours to ﬁll me with hope ;' and
talks as if life were a possession which
he-valued. He reminds me how oﬂen
the same accidents have happened to
other navigators, who have attempted
this .ea, and, in spite of myself, he ﬁlls
me with cheerful auguries. Even the
sailors feel the power of his eloquence :
when he speaks, they no longer despair ;
he- muses their energies, and, while «
. they hearhis voice, they believe these
vast ‘mountains of ice are mole-hills,
which will vanish beforethe resolutions
of man. These feelingsiare transitory;
each day of expectation delayed ﬁlls
them with fear, and I almost dread a
mutiny caused by this despair.
