22 FRANKENSTEIN; on,

‘take place in the atmosphere and
weather. ,

About two o’clock the mist cleared
away, and we beheld, stretched out in
every direction, vast and irregular plains
of ice, which seemed to have no end.
Some of my comrades groaned, and my
own mind began to grow watchful with
anxious thoughts, when a strange sight
suddenly attracted our attention, and
diverted our solicitnde from our own
situation. We perceived a low carriage,
ﬁxed on a sledge and drawn by dogs,
pass on towards the north, at the distance
of half a mile: a being which had the
shape of a man, but apparently of gi-
gantic stature, sat in the sledge, and
guided the dogs. We watched the rapid
progress of the traveller with our te-
lescopes, until he was lost among the
distant inequalities of the ice. '
