misery I appeared to suffer, he hastened
to return home, hoping the quiet and
monotony of a domestic life would by
degrees alleviate my sufferings from
whatever cause they might spring.

of earth and sky passed before me like
a dream, and that thought only had to
me the reality of life. Can you wonder,
that sometimes a kind of insanity pos-
sessed me, or that I saw ‘continually
about me a multitude of ﬁlthy ani-
mals inﬂicting on me incessant-torture,
that often extorted screams and bitter
groans? .
