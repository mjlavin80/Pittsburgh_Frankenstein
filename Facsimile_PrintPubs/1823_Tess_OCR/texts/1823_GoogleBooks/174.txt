discovered, Justine. had been taken ill,
and conﬁned to her bed; and, after se-
veral days, one of the servants, hap-
pening to examine the apparel she had
worn on the night of thelmnrder, had
discovered in her pocket the picture of
mymother, which had been judged to
be the temptation of the murderer. The
servant instantly showed it to one of the
others, who, without saying a word to
any of the family, went to a magistrate ;
and, upon their deposition, Justine was
apprehended. On being charged with
the fact, the poor girl conﬁrmed the
suspicion in a great measure by her ex-
treme confusion of manner. .

This was a strange tale, but it did not
shake my faith ; and I replied earnestly,
“ You are all mistaken; I know the mur-
derer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is
innocent.”
