, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS. 9

I shall depart for the latter town in
a fortnight or three weeks; and my in-
tention is to hire a ship there, ‘which can
easily be done by paying the insurance
for the owner, and to engage as many
sailors asI think necessary among those
who are accustomed to the whale-ﬁshing.
ldo not intend to sail until the month of"
June; and when shall I return.> Ah,
dear sister, how can I answer this ques-
tiou P If I succeed, many, many months,
pelhaps years, will pass before you and
[may meet. If I fail, you will see me
again soon,,or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent, Mar-
garet. Heaven shower down blessings.
0H you, and save me, that I may again
and again testify my gratitude for all
YOur love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,
. R. WALTON.
