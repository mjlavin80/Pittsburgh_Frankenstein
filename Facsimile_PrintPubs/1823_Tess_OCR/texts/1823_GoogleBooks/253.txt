CHAPTER XI.

“ I LAY on my straw, but I could not
sleep. I thought of the occurrences of
the day. What chieﬂy struck me was
the gentle manners of these people; and
I longed to join them, but dared not.
I remembered too well the treatment I
had suffered the night before from the
barbarous villagers, and resolved, what-
ever course of conduct I might hereafter
think it right to pursue, that for the
present I would remain quietly in my
hovel, watching, and endeavouring to
discover the motives which inﬂuenced
their actions.
