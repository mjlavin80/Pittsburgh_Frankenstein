THE MODERN mionrmnws. 61

CHAPTER II.

WHEN I had attained the age of seven-
teen, my parents resolved that I shouldr
become a student at the university of
Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended
the schools of Geneva; but my father
thought it necessary, for the comple-
tion of my education, that I should be
made acquainted with other customs
than those of my native country. My
departure was therefore ﬁxed at an
early date; but, before the day resolved
upon could arrive; the ﬁrst misfortune
of my life occurred—an omen, as it
Were, of my future misery.
